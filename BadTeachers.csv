Hello everyone! I've implemented some new rules for this sub and rewritten its description. Please take a moment to make note of these changes as the new rules will be promptly implemented from this moment onward.,"This was a subreddit that I created with a friend back in high school some years ago and I decided to revisit it today in order to make some much-needed modifications. I'm hoping that these new implementations will establish the culture we had desired for this sub and encourage content submissions on the page that are befitting of our original intentions for this community. Though this is a subreddit dedicated to sharing experiences and instances of incompetent academic instruction, please take note that I am insistent on maintaining an atmosphere that refrains free of hate-speech, insults of racist undertones, use of slurs or blatantly derogatory terms, and any instances of witch-hunts. I've seen rather unsightly reports in my inbox over the last few days and I'd like to remind everyone that this type of content is not something that will be tolerated. In order to guarantee this, I will take action as needed in order to maintain a standard baseline of human respect in this community which includes post/comment removal and user banning if deemed necessary. We're all here to joke, poke fun, and be entertained. Let's do our best to keep it at that and not attempt to tear down the livelihood or reputation of others.

With all of that being said, thank you for being a member of this page and I hope you all enjoy your time here!"
Teacher with questionable teaching?,"Hello I'm not really active on reddit and still pretty new. My grammar isn't the best lol so I'll try and clarify for any questions.

Anyway this story takes place not to long ago back when I was in grade 9 (currently going into 11) my language arts teacher seemed like a pretty good teacher. For the first few weeks of school getting to know everyone, telling us about herself, and even getting to know her hobbies. But after about a month in I started to realize that we weren't really learning a lot as our classes were just her life story or just reading a book and talking about it all class repeatedly. Towards the middle of the school year she got very political and putting her views on to us, I found this kinda messed up as at the time most of us were only 13 to 14 and not even close to being able to vote. If nobody supported her side in anything she'd never really pay attention to them even if they needed help onto anything. Before COVID-19 hit us she got karma (as most of my classmates put it) as she was preparing for her sewing class later that day and ended up chopping off a part of her pinky finger. She missed classes until the beginning of March and between the time of the incident and when she came back we learned absolutely nothing with writing only 1 essay that everyone failed because it just didn't make sense with what we learned. When we switched to online classes nothing changed it was just the same old things just on computers and when school ended apparently someone on the school council ripped into about her teaching methods. This is a little shorter version of everything but if you have questions feel free to ask"
Sucky Lunch Lady,"In Elementary school there were teachers that would walk around and would help kids that needed help and you would have to ask permission to go to the bathroom etc. I already had a bad history with this teacher and she made no sense at all. I asked to go to the bathroom and she said I had to finish my food first, sent me to naughty table for asking my friend for chips and so on. In this story we had just gotten done with lunch and we were in a line to go back to class and before we were about to leave one of the obnoxious loud kids started yelling out loud in our line and the lunch teacher heard this and came by and asked ""who was yelling?"" everyone and I mean EVERYONE pointed at him including myself and she said ok and as our line was moving out of the lunch building she pulled me aside and said ""why were you yelling"" and I said ""It wasn't me"" and she said ""don't lie to me"" and I said ""Ma'am it was the other kid and everybody pointed at him its not me"" and she said ""yeah whatever"" and sent me on my way. honestly hated her and glad I don't have to deal with her BS anymore."
My teacher who tried to accuse me of sexual harrassment,"Now before I tell the story I want to say this I guess I was kinda in the wrong but she did was nothing short of evil



So this started at fifth grade I was twelve and my friend Michael told me a joke it was how I 1 2 half 6 with 2 sounded like so I wrote it down then threw it away and one kid I'll call her Jessica so she picked it up and gave it to kylie (my crush) and everyone knew this and she obviously told the teacher and she said one more thing and I would get detention even though she didn't even lt me explain and at the cafeteria kylie told everyone about it so a bully I'll just call him josh was flipping a mini milk carton and saying stuff like: if this lands kylie and ""hydra"" will get married and other dumd and explicit stuff and every time he did he would tell kylie I did it and she told the guidance teacher and stuff and our teacher who got no wind of this just sends me to detention again not letting me explain and tells my parents that it said I want to have s** with you even though it was numbers but we got it resolved because of eye witnesses and I also want to say thanks Ethan who was one of the witnesses and my friend back then but she didn't get fired but still got in trouble for not seeking evidence 


I again was in the wrong for writing it down in the first place so yeah but next time check the evidence she also hated me for unknown reasons and I'm kinda glad for covid cuz I don't have to see her face anymore"
Nursing year 1 semester 1,"As the title says, the following took place during my academics in obtaining my nursing license...graduated in 2008.

First month in my anatomy class. The professor was a well established nurse at the college that I was attending and in the nursing community overall. First topic we covered was the skeletal system. 

The day before the test on said subject, the professor decides to have an open book review. After going through the whole basic bone structure, she asked if anyone had any questions before we went into further detail. 

I raised my hand and asked if she was sure that the scientific name for the bones at the wrist was metatarsal and those at the ankle was metacarpal.

She chuckled in a sarcastically amused manner and assured me that she was correct in saying that.

To which I asked why when athletes, like tennis players, get chronic wrist pains it's referred to as ""metacarpal syndrome"".

A few minutes of blank stare and eyeball shaking, she looks at the class and says...""So yeah, these are your carpals,"" pointing to her wrist, ""and these are your tarsals,"" just points to the ground. 

At that point, I saw several of my classmates frantically scratch out words in their books and rewrite other words."
Knowing what a quiz is.,"With collage being online, the teachers seem to have different teaching methods in place. That's ok but my teacher makes TIMED QUIZZES. My teacher gives us material to study logical fallacies. In the quiz, he timed us to find REAL LIFE examples of them. I struggled to find the 2 that was needed and only found 1. So I only got half of my quiz result due to the fact I wasn't good at treasure hunting for a example. The quiz did not test my knowledge of what I learned, in turn, it tested how well I can surf the internet. Thanks to that now I have a lower grade."
Imagine getting a bad grade because of expressing your opinion,"(This is part 2 of my story)
So fast forward 6 months from the previous incident.This time it was citizenship and civic education (the subject where you have to learn how to be a good citizen, government forms, constitution,etc.) teacher.So usually they have to be politically neutral (at least in my country (im not from us) don't know about other countries tho),but this particular individual is different.She has this strong political believe that come off like a propaganda when she teach,she always blame the cirrent gov for everything because they came from different political beliefs.So now on to my story, it's the final exam and on the paper she asks opinion about a very sensitive current political issues and i fill in my opinion.And because my opinion was different from hers she gave me a D for final exam ignoring other questions i got right.This lower my average score on my report card shattering my hope to get a scholarship into my dream uni.So yeah i have to study real hard to pass the selection test for my dream uni wish me luck guys!"
A music teacher,"Hi. It’s my first time here, but I had a terrible teacher once. He was a music teacher that was decent at teaching general 7th grade music, but whenever we had free time, he would tell his opinions to everyone in the class. I have no idea why. He acted like a internet troll, but in real life, and you were stuck with him for 45 minutes a day. One day he went on and on about one kid on his daughters volleyball team, that, in his words “is to fat to be a setter”. Another was how the weekend sports kids are snowflakes. And on and on. It got more political too, about how masks are ineffective and the government is hiding stuff from us. We recently moved, and I am so very glad to be away from his class. Anyway, if you got this far, thanks.

Geometry & PTSD,"My freshman year of high school, our geometry teacher was a Vietnam vet, who like too many others that went there, had a terrible experience, and returned with a severe case of PTSD.

He was actually a rather good geometry teacher, and clearly knew his subject. The problem was, certain noises, smells, or words would cause him to have flashbacks, and he would get a panic attack so severe, he'd think he was back in the war again. In one instance, out of the blue, he went from writing something on the blackboard to suddenly yelling ""Get down!!!"". He grabbed my friend's head, slammed it into their desk so hard, it left a baseball-sized bruise on their cheek, and wrenched the poor kids neck on top of that. My friend was out for almost a month because of that incident, but the teacher didn't get fired because the school was fully aware of his PTSD and knew that something like this might happen.

Needless to say, not one kid in his class acted out, was disrespectful, or ever did anything bad to him, so I guess that was one silver lining."
Spanish Chemistry,"My sophmore year of high school, the school hired a new Chemistry teacher. The only problem was, when they hired her, she didn't know a single word of English, as she was born & raised in Spain and never botherd to learn English until the day she started teaching here in the US. Don't ask me how this happened, not one of us in her class that year could figure out why, and it wasn't from a lack of effort. So throughout the year, most of the students that actually grew up speaking Spanish would take turns getting up to the front of the class and translate for her as she would often begin each sentence in very broken English, then finish it in Spanish. This was pretty much a daily occurrence. We all agreed that it was good she wasn't teaching AP Chemsitry, since we all very much doubted anyone, even the Hispanic students, would pass, given the way she taught.

In fairness, she probably would've made a great Spanish teacher (even though we already had a great Spanish teacher at the school who was born & raised in Peru but unlike her, spoke perfect English) but between her inability to speak a coherent sentence in English, and the fact she had some.... interesting.... hygiene habits that most of the students mocked her for behind her back, she only lasted one year at our school."
Making me hate the work,"For context, I’m in an animation corse, learning 2D animation. Before this I (and most of the class) had never touched animation before. 

I love animation and I genuinely think this is what I want to do for a career. 

This teacher started the first class saying that this will make some of us cry. Bluntly saying that Atleast half of us will drop out. Great first impression. 

We started a ball animation and I thought that went well. (My file was corrupted and I had to start again but oh well) then we did a flour sack. 

We submitted this and everyone thought we did ok, considering for some people this was thier first animations. 

This class we got SLAMED, he started with “great news guys, I now expect much less of you” because apparently we are all lazy and will never get a job because we didn’t put in 40 hours into this project. (We have 3 other classes a week that also need attention) 

He went on to tell us how so many of us almost failed because one minor thing was off. 

Teachers should not hope for their students to drop out."
I have 3 bad teachers in a single school (I will tell the last one tommorow),"Last year around the first wave of Covid (around June-end of October).My parents who both works in medical fields get tested positive for Covid and just in 3 days i get tested and the result was also positive(Note that i always followed the Covid protocols and barely even go outside so it's definitely come from my parents).I some symptoms ranging from fever,lost sense of smell,diarrhea.So automatically i am unable to attend online school for around a 3-4 weeks.Long story short,I finally able to attend online school and this one teacher told me that i have to finish 4 weeks worth of math assignment that i know nothing about and gave me 2 days to finish it because she said that they need the marks to fill the mid-semester report card.Thank god one of my friend was kind enough to send his work for me to copy.The next day,this time the PE teacher told that all boys must come to school(and yes Quarantine is still mandatory in my place at that time) to take a Physical Endurance test for the same reason as the Math teacher,to fill the report card.So I ask him to not do an Endurance test and ask for a paper test.He refused and said that I have to come and must do the test.Hence i done it almost Fainted  and failed rhe test.I literally felt so weak after that and can't attend online school for an additional week."
Teacher suggest that my sister to be kept a distance away from her friends due to her tics.,"So this happened very recently (yesterday), for a little bit of context one of my sister’s tics went off. This tic made her grab arms grab her two friends sitting on each side of her (so like left arm grabs person on the left, right arm grabs person on the right). Her tic wouldn’t allow her to let go of her friends’ arms also this happened at the end of class so none of them could go to their classes (they were all in different lessons for the next lesson). The teacher told the three of them to stay while she called two teachers. The two teachers came to the classroom they were in and my sister explained why she couldn’t let go. Also to keep in mind these teachers know about my sister’s tics, so what do they tell me sister to do? “Well they need to get to their classes, so you really need to let them go”. My sister can’t let them go, because her tic won’t let her! Anyway my sister did say to them, “Well how can I let them go if my tics won’t let me, you know I can’t let them go, because my tics won’t let me” the two teachers said nothing and walked out. My sister’s teacher stayed in the classroom of course and in the end my sister’s tic did stop and they got to class.                 

Fast forward a little while later.

My mum gets a call by one of the teachers that went into the classroom. Well what did this teacher suggest they could do my sister? Well she suggested that keeping my sister away from everyone in her classes like in the same classroom, but just away from other students, oh and to make sure my sister’s friends and other students to keep a distance away from her during break and lunch! Like what the heck this isn’t gonna nice for my sister at all, they’re basically saying “Stay away from [sister’s name] at all times”, my sister got really upset about this, because she can’t control her tics and she said she’s gonna feel like she’s being isolated and treated differently. The teacher suggested this because “We care about the welfare of our students”. Well if they cared so much about students’ welfare then why did they ignore the fact my sister or her friends were getting bullied by other kids? Oh that’s right, because they didn’t want to deal with it only one teacher sorted it out and it wasn’t that teacher. That teacher (who called) knows that my sister’s mental health can easily go bad if students were told to keep away from her, which would make my sister feel like a burden due to her tics."
The teacher that most of the school HATED.,"I used to attend a private middle school, and our art/music teacher was one of the most strict, and most hated teachers I've ever met. We'll call her Ms.A). Ms.A would make us line up in front of the door, and if we learned something from the last week, we would have had to memorize it with no warning, IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ENTER THE CLASSROOM. Considering we would need to take notes, and since this was an art class, we would need to use the materials that we bought with OUR MONEY, right? Well, Ms.A had a rule that made it so that whenever you dropped something, IT WAS NOW MS.A's PROPERTY! I graduated a few years ago, but if I remember, a girl lost her glasses to the hands of Ms. A. 

By the way, my class has one guy who would always talk, and he was what you could call ""the weird kid"". He was the sole reason most benefits ere taken away from my class in particular. Ms. A was so strict, she wouldn't allow us to even whisper to each other while we're in line/in class. If he heard someone talking, SHE WOULD MAKE US WALK DOWN AND UP 3 STORIES OF STAIRS (art/music floor is on third floor). The worst part? We had to carry our backpacks with us the entire time, since it was our last class. Since it was on a Thursday, WHICH MEANT MOST OF OUR TESTING WOULD BE TOMORROW, MOST OF US HAD PLANNED TO BRING OUR TEXTBOOKS HOME! The back pain was un-bearable. Probably my worst teacher, I couldn't imagine having her as homeroom."
Asking for opinion: were they bad teachers ?,"This is the first time I have even dared to think of them as being ""bad"" because everyone in the school seems to love them. But I think it may be a good time to ask for some real opinions. 

Teacher A is well loved by students, but I think he is a bad teacher because he makes really sexually explicit jokes and somehow those jokes got passed off by all students as being harmless. He likes to detain students after-class to help them with ""homework"" and they happen to be almost all girls. Also likes to talk about his female student's physical attributes. I find him gross and decided I wouldn't talk to him. We had a fallout and the school intervened. I never told the school what had happened, but then he continued to teach there until present day, is he a bad teacher? 

Teacher B is from Cambridge and is a single mother. Don't get me wrong, she is wonderful and such. But when I ask her whether she thinks I should apply to the school (cambridge) with my grades, she told me that I wouldn't stand a chance and should not even try. Now I came from a prestigious private high school in North America and my GPA is 93%, and with my grade in history being 100% throughout all three years. I have also had 2AP history courses and ended up getting a perfect grade on them as well. Also scored 800 on 2 SAT history subject tests. I don't understand why she is being so critical/sour about me. I can feel like she doesn't like me, but why would she lie about me not having a chance at applying to cambridge ? I ended up not applying to the school and regret about it since I took her opinion seriously."
My teacher was a bitch,"When I was in high school I was put into the ""special"" class due to the fact I have mild Asperger's (my emotions are muted and often fleeting). Teaching this ""class"" was a woman I will refer to as Mrs. E. Mrs. E had taught the class for years and was apparently used to dealing with students whose conditions were NOT mild, so when I got to class she seemed to take offense to the fact that I was fully cognitive. She would treat me like everything I said was nonsense, reasonable requests that most other teachers would allow she would utterly dismiss and she would never take criticism, bad or constructive. This seemed to come to a head when she assigned a stupidly simple worksheet to the class, I finished it in a couple minutes and turned it in. Soon after she decided I did it to fast and gave me another of the SAME worksheet, as if that would solve anything. I was annoyed, but I did that worksheet just as fast as the first, I turned it in and she couldn't seem to accept that I wasn't mentally challenged and gave me the same worksheet again. At this point I was greatly annoyed and refused to do the third copy of the worksheet, to which she proceeded to yell and verbally berate me for not doing the assigned work, I ignored her and simply read the book I had with me. While I was reading she attempted to snatch the book away from me, which she failed and demanded that I give her my book, which I refused. She continued to scream and yell, going so far as to bring like minded teachers in to yell at me as well, all while I sat there silently ignoring them. This kept going for nearly half an hour before my parents were called. They, unlike most parents, agreed with me over the hysterical teacher. After all that I was not punished in any way and was even praised by my parents. Really the only downside was that I was pretty much on Mrs. E's shit list for the rest of school, and she was my second worst teacher!"
My teacher who shames my looks,"I do still have this teacher but thankfully not for long as I'm changing schools soon.

So whenever it's a school photos day or something that has to do with taking pictures of me I always fear for the worst and it really doesn't help as I have major anxiety. For example, my teacher shames my smile, weight and even my eye shape. She shames me on how skinny I am, and tells me to gain more weight as I'd look like a skeleton soon. So she always tells the people who make the lunches in the school kitchen to give me extra food as telling them that I haven't had my breakfast and that I'm ""hungry"". Which is annoying because you're always forced to eat almost all your food before you can go out to break and I always end up either struggling to eat it all or almost throwing up in the bathrooms after eating it all.
There's also the shaming of my smile and teeth. Now my teeth aren't perfect as I have sticky out bunny teeth and my smile is crooked as I can never smile on command properly. And my teacher makes me never want to smile or show my teeth. She tells me to smile, I smile for the camera and she either tells me to not do my ugly smile or to not smile at all because my smile is fricked (she uses the word frick instead of fuck or she'd get in trouble for swearing at the students). My eyes are also quite small and kinda slanted as I have some asian heritage but my teacher doesn't care. She tells me my eyes looks like I've been beaten and that their so slanted it looks like they're about to fall off. 
And it's not only me who has this happen, it's basically the whole class. As she does racist actions to the different toned skin people in my class and fat shames other people who aren't even overweight in any kind."

A bad teacher gives a bad grade on a paper that's way too advanced.,"Let me start this off by saying that I am 14m and just finished my freshman year of high school.
The school that I go to, I had to take a test and an interview to get in, and this school is the best high school in my area. This school is very academically challenging, but that is to be expected. The problem is that my honors humanities teacher is bad. I feel that I can't really judge him as I've only had him online, and everyone who has had him in person says that he is great, and he seems nice and fun. The problem comes with the last essay of the year though.
A bit of background: he was on paternity leave for the first semester, and we had a sub who wasn't very good, but that's to be expected. Near the end of the first semester, she tells us that we have a paper comparing 2 characters from ancient epics, due in the middle of the 2nd semester. The real teacher comes in at the start of the second semester, and he said ""Your sub was bad and did not teach you how to write a proper paper, so now I will need to teach you all myself"" He proceeded to not talk about essays again until the end of the term, telling us how to turn it in. He also did not teach. All we did in class was ""essay workshop time"".
Now all I knew about writing essays was from middle school, writing 4 paragraph essays, with RACE body paragraphs. Since I had no rubric that contradicted this, I wrote a nice, 2-page RACE essay. I got a D on it, as there were NO mandatory office hours or an option to turn in a rough draft for comments. I was fine with it, though, and accepted the grade.
Another problematic thing is that when approached with the question: Why have we not gotten any grades most of the way through the term? He responded ""I do not grade outside of school hours."" WHAT! I do give him a bit of slack because we are virtual, but still.
The real problem came at the beginning of the fourth and last term, in which he started our first class of the term by assigning a 12 PAGE PAPER due at the end of the year. You read that right 12 pages. For freshmen. 14 and 15-year-olds. I was kind of ok with this even though it is a bit crazy to assign a college-level paper to freshmen because this is a ""good school"".
This was a really advanced paper with the prompt: should historians consider folktales and oral traditions as history. He gave us 9 sources to use, all of them pre- 1980 and very advanced journal articles. Again, he is assigning a college-level paper TO 14-YEAR-OLDS. So I work hard on this paper with my mom. In the end, I am proud of my final product, and turn it in 2 weeks before the end of school. He doesn't grade this thing until AFTER school was over for a week
I got a 75.
This is after I went to his office hours to go over it. Where he only went over the introduction, grading it as if it were the body of the paper, going through it sentence by sentence, not even reading the whole thing before giving comments. Also, along with grading very late, he only gave me a number grade. No comments or anything.
So of course I email him, if not to try to change my grade, at least to know why I got such a bad grade. After no response, my mom emailed him because she feels somewhat responsible, copying the principal, asking the same thing. He replies by saying that he will make a PDF of the paper with the comments by the end of that weekend. We don't get it until Tuesday night. Looking through the PDF, he was obviously covering his ass, giving about 100 comments. Some were valid pointing out passive voice etc, but some were blatant lies.
We are debating going to the principal, not really to get him fired, but just to be aware of his lack of teaching, but we are debating trying to light a fire under him."

"When I was in kindergarten, my teacher told us thunder was the sound of two clouds crashing into each other.","As a high school student, looking back on this, what the hell? Did she think we wouldn’t be able to understand the truth?"
Just a bit of a petty rant lol,"Okay so in P6 ( I believe that is the British equivalent to 4th grade). I got into a fight with one of my friends and starting crying. My teacher came up to me and basically said I was overreacting and that I should stop because 'You're a really ugly crier'. Obviously I immediately stopped but I was shocked that a teacher of like 9 to 10 year olds took that approach to two children having an argument. It never properly got solved and it took us talking it out a few years later. We were in the same class for the final year of primary and the first day, our new teacher pulled us aside and basically said 'I heard you two have beef, but I don't want that in my class'. Like my old teacher bitched about us to our new teacher and said just make them stop. We were amicable and generally quite mature for now like 11 year olds and it just felt really rude that she didn't think we could at least still work together without it turning into a cat fight!!!"
Why did my philosophy teacher do this?,"My philosophy teacher is a pretty cool guy, flawed and eccentric, but he's always been alright in my book. He likes anime, video games and he tries to be different from the other teachers (who are all about as old as my grandpa btw). I'm in my last few weeks of high school, and I'm about to turn in an assignment, when for some reason, google drive decides to stop working. Basically I had to record myself explaining how Greek philosophers would react to today's politics. I recorded the video and tried to upload it, but it failed. I tried about ten times before giving up and messaging my teacher. Our conversation went something like this.

Me: Hello <PROFESSOR>, I'm having trouble uploading my video onto Google Classroom, could I send it over to you another way?

<PROFESSOR>: No. You're in group ""B"". Your group didn't respond to any of my messages, so no.

Me: What does that have to do with my assignment? I can't upload it to Google Classroom!

<PROFESSOR>: Well, too bad.

He's been especially bad lately and honestly I'm thinking about reporting this to the principal. I tried talking to him as respectfully as I could be he didn't listen. Am I wrong in thinking this is bad?"
Lego project,"So this may totally be on me but when I was in 10th grade I made a lego plane from some rare pieces for a project. I received a passing grade and my teacher asked ""can I display your project in the museum?"" I was very hesitant because I was very defensive over my Legos. Then I asked her ""will I get them back?"" My teacher said to come back at the end of the year. Like a gullible kid, I did exactly that and she wasn't there... 

Point being, if you love your project, don't let a teacher manipulate you into giving it to them 👌"
Math classes based on first language classes,"In first grade at my school one could come in easy or more advanced class in math and first language class (norwegian). While this was a good idea to make sure evryone was keeping up and no one was getting bored, it was not executed right.
This was since my teacher decided that everyone that was bad in norwegian was also bad in math. And this also did so that many people whom where good at math just kept quiet so they could get no homework.
And even when one asked to be transferred they would pressure you multiply times to stay in the class you where in."
Why Online Classes Don't Work in College,"I am in a masters counseling program, and am currently taking summer courses. At the end of the semester, we get to review the class and the final question was ""Do you have any additional comments?"" This was my response:

""Yeah. What the hell. I know that isn't professional but this is the epitome of everything that is wrong with online classes. She never talked to us, she posted everything at once and assumed we understood it all, there were no presentations or any materials that indicates that she put ANY effort into this class. She hasn't even graded anything and we are in week 5 of a 6 week class. If I wanted to read a book and teach myself about this material, I would have just done that without paying thousands of dollars for it. This is an embarrassment for the counseling program. She should be embarrassed about the amount of effort she put into this (which is obviously none). I wonder if she even remembers that she is supposed to be teaching a class. I looked her up online, and she seems to be a very competent person. Maybe she is too busy to be teaching, or maybe teaching just isn't for her. Maybe it's just because this was an online course and she hates virtual learning as much as the rest of us do. But honestly, I don't care. This class was horrible to be in, and I will never take a class with her again.

I feel like I am screaming into an abyss because I know that this review does not matter. This counseling program has been such a joke. I am not going to go into the field prepared to help people when this is how I am being taught. You think I know anything about marriage and family therapy after submitting 5 discussion posts and writing a single paper? I would be shocked if anyone is even reading this, because it does not feel like anyone on the administration side of this program gives a shit about the students. I know I am not the first person to complain about this teacher or this program, and I am certain I will not be the last, because we all know nothing is ever going to change.""

I am sick of screaming into the abyss that is my counseling program, so I thought I would scream into the abyss that is the internet. Thank you for listening."
Headteacher 'forced secretary to take raunchy lingerie photos of her in school',
"Oof, wow, where do I even begin.","UK, 17, so not in a “University” college, just in an actual college. 

One of our lecturers finally got fired last week, thank god. She deserved it. Here’s why:

She only ever favoured guys. Every girl in our class got lower grades than they actually achieved with their work. Distinction level work was only ever down at pass level, merit if they were lucky. But all of the guys had the grades they achieved.

During online school she was constantly flirting with a student. Not even kidding, actual proper flirting with one of the students. The student was seeing how far he could take it so he could report it.

She had constant arguments with multiple students, and only female students. One of which she actually closed the classroom door on. Not in front of her, not without contact, she closed the door on her leg and left a bruise. Another student had her grades bumped down, work not marked, resubmissions were “lost”, etc.

I had previously studied the same course at a different location but dropped out due to personal reasons I don’t feel comfortable sharing. My teachers were made aware of this, and this one particular teacher started treating me like a book of knowledge. She asked me multiple times if I thought what she had said was correct, she asked me multiple times which lesson to go ahead with, she asked me which lesson plan to use, and she asked me to help teach other students. She used a classmate’s (homework) powerpoint in her lesson and attempted to pass it off as her own. Things like this continued.

She introduced herself as an ex lecturer at both Oxford university teaching physics, and London Imperial College teaching mechanical engineering. Not possible, since the moment I asked a simple question about mechanical engineering, she drew a blank. (I’ve never studied it but my dad used to be a mechanical engineer, and has now moved up in the company). Her LinkedIn profile says she taught in the University of Hertfordshire. And that was updated 2 years ago, just before she joined the college.

Oh, a physics teacher who believed the moon landing was faked. 

She refused to teach our class some parts of the course. Flat out absolutely refused to teach it. We have all done terribly on those assignments. 

She spent way too long teaching one of her units, so we didn’t start another unit until much later than we should have, so we all had a backlog of assignments. We had 5 assignments due in the span of 2 weeks, twice. I’ve fallen behind massively due to this, cause all of those at once creates too much stress for me to actually complete the work, let alone start it. 

We needed plenty of time to catch up on, and complete, assignments. Our other lecturers had finished teaching, so every lesson with them was letting us work on assignments. This lecturer, however, despite not finishing teaching, gave us lessons to work on assignments too. But, when we started complaining, she decided to make us do practical experiments, not teach us the remainder of the course, or let us work on assignments. 

There is more that I am certain I’m missing, but I’ve completely forgotten. So that sucks.

But that is the story of our worst teacher ever. And how she’s finally been fired."
My creepy teacher,"so my spanish teacher had to leave for the rest of the year because she was having a baby so we got a substitute teacher we will call him Mr C., Mr C was ok at first then he got after the guys way more then the girls. One of my classmates(male) threw a piece of gum(in the rapper) a few inches and got in huge trouble but a female classmate threw a shoe across the room and he did nothing. He would also just stared at all the girls weird and creepily. And a random thing, he would make fun of the homeless, we got told he was getting kicked out his house and was going to be come homeless if we didn't find him somewhere for him to stay till his house was done being built. The other classes he has say he has said some creepy, non teacher-like things to them and they have tried to report him to the principal but that didn't work. Am I just overreaching or does anyone have advice?"

"English teacher favors alot of students, and Im one of the ones She doesnt like.","So my English teacher favors alot of students, mostly females,
She always is hard on students She doesnt like But easy going with the rest.
It was fine until her opinion started affecting my grades, i have had A as my grade in english class for 5 years But now suddenly put of the blue,
She gave me an E, which in sweden means you barely passed.
I have requested some other english teachers to tell me which grade some of my essays deserve, they all Said A and B, Never an E.
I am mad and want to go against her but She i have No idea how.

Ps. For some reason autocorrect made alot of letters capital, i couldnt fix it.

Any suggestions on how i could stop her?"
I had to teach my science teacher a very basic concept.,"I had to teach my 6th grade science teacher a VERY BASIC science lesson........

We were learning about the atmosphere and how air pressure decreases as altitude increases blah blah blah 4th/5th grade stuff.  Then she starts talking about the astronauts on the International Space Station.  I’m interested in that type of stuff so I opened my ears.  She says, “Because there’s no air in space, that’s why the astronauts are floating around.”  I made a visibly confused face, because that is the stupidest thing a teacher has ever said.  I raise my hand and gave her a very specific answer.  “Actually, the reason why the astronauts float around in space is because they are constantly falling around the Earth.  Each time they orbit, they fall around the Earth.  The ONLY time air comes into play is air resistance.  Also, there is obviously air INSIDE of the space station so they can breathe.”  Then she says, “Well, only astronauts know that.”  I hate that teacher."
Got reminded of this time my teacher f*ed me over and almost made me cry in front of the class,"Just a rant, I got reminded of this event that happened before the quarantine and I was never able to resolve the situation with the teacher cuz.. we all went into quarantine.

Anyways, my high school math teacher had been telling us that she would be going on leave for a surgery she had to do (nothing life threatening or important honestly, I can’t remember what it was but it was nothing huge) for almost a month, and because she would be going on leave, she scheduled all of the tests and quizzes we’d be having that month (including our midterm) and the dates didn’t seem to be changing any time soon. 

So, a week before the midterm, I came down with a huge fever (it wasn’t coronavirus, this was before all that) and skipped 3 days of school. During those three days, I knew that I would be missing 2 of the math tests that were scheduled and had already emailed my teacher about them. She told me I could take them during my lunch period when I came back. I asked her if I had missed anything else, and she responded saying I HADN’T. 

Monday morning, after a weekend and my 3 day absence, I came to class thinking about all the tests I had to make up later (I was a junior, and it was close to midterms for the rest of my classes), when my friend who sat in front of me turned around and asked “are you ready for midterms?” ????????????????????

I responded with “what tf? What are you talking about?” I knew that midterms were scheduled for that FRIDAY, the last day my teacher stayed in class before going on medical leave. I looked around, and everybody had their notes out on their desks doing last minute studying. It may seem like an over exaggeration but I felt nauseous. I had a C in that class and was hoping to be able to bring my grade up with this midterm, and I realized that if I failed it, I’d never get my grade above a C. I honestly didn’t even respond to my friend and went to the teacher, sitting behind her desk, and asked her what was going on.

I told her that I had been absent since last Wednesday and I thought the midterm was on Friday. She tells me “oh, I told the class that the date changed last Friday cause I decided to go on leave sooner.” 
I asked her why she didn’t tell me in the most polite way I could bc I had emailed her on Thursday asking her to tell me if anything important happens. All of a sudden, she puts the blame on me by raising her voice in a very very quiet classroom about how she NEEDS To leave this Tuesday and how I can’t take the test during lunch after studying for a bit because I have to make up my other 2 tests during the lunch period.
Then she out of the blue starts grilling me about how I should’ve always been prepared for a midterm no matter what the date of it was because I always had to be prepared in her class. 
I’ve had terrible social anxiety my entire life and this entire event almost made me cry on the spot. She told me “there’s nothing I can do for you” and made me go back to my seat to take the test (I failed, obviously. I didn’t get to study any of the formulas I would’ve forgotten.)

AND, to top off how selfish she was, she made me take two long ass 50+ question tests with VERY long math questions during a 40 min lunch period, and despite knowing all of the questions and how to do them, I just had no time for all of them. I failed both terribly because she was trying to rush me so she could go on leave earlier and not wait after school for me. 

THE WORST THING IS she ended up staying in class until Thursday!!!!!! She had rushed me to take 3 tests I want prepared for and had no time for, making me fail the semester cuz I had no way of getting back from those 3 massive F’s, and she had just decided to stay three more days when she made me believe she was rushing to leave town Monday afternoon. She’s honestly the reason I don’t trust many teachers at all anymore."
Actual reply my Spanish teacher sent too a student asking for help,
My teacher doesn't seem to know what she wants (a mini rant),"I'm currently in college for Software Development and one of my mandatory classes is a communications class that improves our communication practices and giving speeches. Our final is an informative speech and we were given a template to follow when writing our outline. We were taught that the outline was for us to follow so we know how our speeches should flow and we followed the template to the T. Today we went over our te.plates and we were critiqued on how we shouldn't have included titles, our names or resources (all things on the template) since we should be the only ones who see our template then we were critiqued on how our outlines didn't provide ENOUGH information so that the professor knows what our speeches are about despite the that thats the whole purpose of the speech (for example I'm doing a speech on Satoru Iwata, the late president and CEO of Nintendo who also was a software developer) and when telling me how she doesn't know what anything I mentioned means since she's not a gamer, I mentioned how that's what the speech is for and I was told I should've written the outline wuth more information so she knows what the speech is about and that makes it sound like she wanted a rough draft of the speeches, not a simple outline which was the assignment. She's very frustrating and the one of the few teachers that I willing crawl back into bed for and go to sleep juat so I don't have to deal with her. Thank God I only have her for 5 fucking weeks."
I got kicked out of class. Story/Rant,"Basically I got kicked out of class (on zoom) because I didn't look at the book the teacher had given us. Now, the teacher did not explicitly say to look it over. She said we would be using it in class and that's it. So I didn't look at it. 
This teacher is known for kicking people out of her classes but for not doing homework for example l, and I always do it. I think it's ridiculous to kick someone out of class for not doing homework in general, but for it to happen in college is just ludacris. At the end of the day who will be affected by doing the homework (or not) is me. Also, kicking me out only lessens what i learn so what the hell is the point and her problem??? 

Anyway, it went something like this:
The teacher asked who looked over the book. I saw a classmate shaking their head no, and i also nodded because i assumed it wouldn't be a big deal and we would just look at the book. I was sorely mistaken. In that instant this woman says ""okay, you two, see you on monday. The rest of you? Who looked it over?"". I got out immediately because I was so pissed and just done. I had already been having a bad day so i just left. Apparently only 4 people stayed.
 Luckily a friend of mine (one of the 4) in the class recorded it without her knowing and I come to find that if I had just not said anything or said ""yeah, i looked at it"" I wouldn't have been kicked out. She didn't ask a single thing about it, didn't ask what they read or anything. All she did was go on to explain what was in the book... Like she couldn't have done that in the first place?"
So I got kicked out for being unresponsive for around half a minute because I spent more time awake last night so I can finish a fucking group project for that teacher. She didn’t even let me explain.,
"A Teacher That Like To Pick On Me, For No Reason","I got average grades all through school, and while in the eighth grade I suddenly was failing. My mom tried to talk to her about it, but my teacher said something along the lines of “I just don’t know what to do with her anymore”...it was the beginning of the school year. It got so bad that they wanted to test me, I got tested and got an IEP. That kind of solved that issue but she went ahead and found other things. She would always pull me into the hall to talk to me. I wasn’t a troublemaker, I was (still am) too anxious for that. My mom emailed the principal about these little “meetings” and they stopped. She then started making a big deal about my phone being in my pocket, instead of my bag. I didn’t trust people so I preferred to keep it on my person. She eventually took my phone (even though I wasn’t using it), but again my mom emailed the principal and everything stopped.

Fun fact: when I got tested I had should have had further testing. But I didn’t, because they didn’t want to. I got the testing done recently and it turns out I have a learning disability. Glad I know that now that I’m 20 years old."
My Bad form teacher,I remember when I was in 10th grade I remember I had my gaming mouse at school because I'm not wasting money to buy another mouse she had said if I see those mouses during study it means that we are playing games and I thought that this was bs
my bad science teacher,I remember when I was in 6th grade I had this awful teacher who made me feel angry all day every [d](https://day.One)ay. she was online and I never met her in real life because she said she was pregnant and she had to stay online and she always ignored my questions she was probably one of the worst teachers i ever had.
Teacher is sexist(and also just a bad teacher),"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So A boy threw a pencil and the teacher called him immature and that he should grow up but yet a girl did a the same thing as him and she was called funny.That Ticks me [off.Im](https://off.Im) in 6TH grade so that's also some context but today we asked if we could go outside.Everyone was gone with their work but she was like no you  can just have a study hall.But we were in good teachers class and we looked out the window and she had taken a class that acts worse then us out it ticked me off i asked why they went out and we didnt.She said that we were having a study hall thing(she actually said this) Me and my Friends all Knew she was making an excuse though .that's why she is our least favorite Teacher"
my web design teacher this year erupted today.," Being in an ict-direction, I have one hour per week of web design. This subject is not taken seriously by anyone really ,and has no point on the rapport, but is -of course- obligatory.

for this post i'm renaming the teacher to mr. Apple, as he's the only ""ict"" teacher we have that uses mac and apple stuff. I'll be replacing me with my online name.

we use a website/app called smartschool. Among other things, it allows teachers to give tasks with details and if needed, files .Smartschool-said app- allows students to view all tasks and upcoming lesson subjects.  
mr apple, in his everlasting genius, continuously refuses to use it. Last week he claims to have verbally announced a task on google meet -*he also refuses to use smartschools' meeting service*\-. No one remembers it, but admittedly his connection was slow at best, so it could've been lost to that.

This weeks' lesson came around and NO ONE had made the task, and mr Apple was furious. After learning no one had made it, he scanned around the class, looking for someone to ask why they hadn't made it, and me being tired of his shit probably showed on my face, as he picked me. the following conversation ensued:  
(translating loosely)

A: So Diggy, why didn't *you* make it?  
D: There was no task in smartschool nor was there a mention of a task in the lesson subj-  
A: ***EXCUSES!!!***  
(I was too tired of him at this point to show any respect)  
D: What, do you expect us to *smell* when a task is to be done?  
(he regained some composure)  
A: If I tell you you have to do a task via meet, you should be able to remember that. you're 16-17 year olds for christs' sake  
(at this point i could've shut up, but he seemed to intent keeping his anger toward me manifest in the form of this convo, so i continued and promised myself to keep my cool just to annoy him)  
D: Yes , we would.  
A: ...  
D: Yet! here's nearly a dozen students. All with no recollection of this announcement. Besides, memory is fallible and you've access to smartschool to allow us to see our tasks, and today's planning is totally empty.  
A: todays planning is not empty! \*he opens a window showing it saying ""Adobe XD"", which was the pettiest attempt at covering up mistakes ever to then not admit the mistake existed\*  
D: It wasn't this morning at 7am , i know, i checked the planning to pack my backpack, and even if it were planned in timely, this still doesn't mention any task, let alone actually has an actual official task.  
A: so you expect me to fill in your smartschool every week or what? really?  
D: It's how we all view tasks and deadlines, and teachers who have us eight hours a week manage to fill in every hour with details on what they're teaching, so i think you can manage to actually give us a task in smartschool when we have a task.  
(I was NOT helping his anger,which was boiling up but being held in during that entire sentence. but this type of stuff had been going on for a year so cut me a break)  
A: \*SMACKS hands on table\* ""AM I YOUR SECRETARY OR WHAT""  
(I hold in my laugh and answer)(note: he uses the female form, showing just a lovely hint of sexism of assigning administrative tasks female)  
D: No, but literally everyone here does administrative tasks; the other teachers who bother to fill in the agenda, even us wh-  
A: DO I TELL YOU HOW TO DO YOUR JOB  
(thank god for my ability to bottle up and not show emotions, because at this point i could've bursted into laughter or anger, but didn't)  
D: Yes. you do. you use your own meeting service outside of the schools', you would have all your pupils use paper agendas just for your-One hour- subject, not to mention the fact that if you were a teacher for a subject i'd actually follow up with post mandatory schooling, your job would literally be to to tell me how to do my future job.  
(he humored me, just standing there in his anger during that entire thing)  
A: \*keeping down his voice\* you done?  
D:  
A: OUT! OUT OF MY CLASSROOM, TO THE STUDY HALL!  
I leave without a word.

after this point, i'm told he didn't really use his leftover time, but mostly was just like ""you wanna leave too?"" to anyone who as much as looked at him wrong and complained about me several times.  
note: ""to the study hall"" was actually inaccurate, and had i not known, i'd have been in trouble because you actually have to fill out a form when kicked out of a class, but of course that's an administrative task and we know how he feels about those.  
Also noting how hard it would be to justify this sanction and uphold it against any scrutiny , as it's considered a heavy sanction (yes i actually checked through our schools' guide to sanctions for this lmao), and i have ZERO sanctions OR warnings before, not a squeak."
Wilfully ignored teacher and shut down his crap,"So I am 6.5 years younger than my sister and there is only the two of us. My sister has a somewhat rare name, let’s call her Beatrice,  and me Sally. We both went to a school that took in pupils from 14-18 and by the time I got there, only the teachers knew who Beatrice was. 

One teacher (chemistry) delighted in calling me Beatrice, every.single.lesson. I got more and more fed up, “that’s my sister sir, my name is sally“, right up to the day in question when I just decided that I wasn’t going to respond any more, if he couldn’t give me the good manners to use my name, I wasn’t going to answer him.

That fateful day, there we are, bent over our textbooks and he calls on me to answer a question I didn’t even put my hand up for. I stopped some time ago volunteering for anything as it so galled me hearing my sister’s name anytime he wanted to chose me for anything. 
I hear him ask a knotty question followed by Beatrice..............Beatrice.............Beatrice.......... The person sitting next to me sighs, and says “that’s her sister sir, I’m sitting next to Sally, remember?” Then I looked up, directly at him, and said “oh, were you speaking to me sir, I’m sorry, I didn’t realise, I didn’t hear my name”. 

He looked back at me and for a second, we just hard stared each other. I could also see the gears turning in his mind. He couldn’t legitimately punish me for ignoring him when he didn’t actually use my name, and it was patently evident, I would be using this avenue in future. 

I didn’t plan on the assistance of a classmate, but her, who didn’t even know my sister, coming out with her line, indicated he was teetering on the edge of “the rest of the class knows I am mixing up two sisters so if I don’t knock this off, I’m the one who is going to look like I am loosing my grip when she continues to ignore me and I can’t do anything about that”."
Crazy meddling piano teacher,"TW- talk about suicidal ideation 

When I was growing up from about 11 years old to starting college I took piano lessons from the piano teacher in the town I grew up in. She was a crazy, conservative religious lady! She definitely was vocal about her beliefs and thought being gay was wrong and listened to Rush Limbaugh. I don’t mind someone having different views or beliefs than myself but trying to push them onto a one’s music students is not cool nor professional. My mother agreed that this piano teacher Ms G was too uptight in her beliefs, she wasn’t bothered enough to do anything about Ms G’s unprofessional behavior. I get a good laugh looking back at all her craziness now. When I had to deal with her, it was not so much. She was also a gossiping meddler and she did some very hurtful things to me with it which I will now elaborate on.

When I was in 8th grade, I had a hard time in school with pretty much everyone picking on me, I will also add that my mother was abusive to me growing up also, mostly verbally and it got way worse by that time. Ms G called and told my mother about some girls in school who were saying nasty things about me and my dumbass egg donor of course didn’t handle it appropriately. I probably should also add that I don’t have anything to do with my mother now and I am in a few subreddits for that too. Anyway, I come home from school and my maternal unit tells me “ I have bad news, you’re being horrendously made fun of” and told me what all Ms G said. My mother said some other awful things basically implying that I deserved the bullying that I was getting. I was devastated by hearing all this and I also felt hugely betrayed by my piano teacher for the way she allowed another student of hers whom I went to school with to bad mouth me that horribly when Ms G should have shut her down! I also seriously contemplated suicide over this. My egg donor made me continue to take lessons from her so I would purposely not practice and play badly even though I was capable of playing very well.

The next time Ms G pulled that same brand of gossiping bullshit on me, I had started college by then. I confronted her over the phone and told her off telling her that I didn’t appreciate her gossiping about me and was done putting up with that nonsense! My mother didn’t like it but I didn’t care and it did feel good to take some power back and stand up for myself for once!

So that’s the end of the story! Thanks for reading and feel free to give feedback."
What do I do now.,"(a bit of a rant) So I've been taking IGCSE art (O-Levels) in my school and I've been finding it increasingly difficult to motivate myself to do my work. I have two art teachers, one I honestly despise. I'm behind in class, and she has reminded me of that time and time again. When we were physically in school, I've had more time to do my work as i had a designated time to as well as free periods of class. But ever since we reverted to online class, even though Ive been putting doing my work on my checklist I would forget or not have motivation to start. I also tend to miss art online classes, I think my mind is trying to avoid it because everytime I log in I have a shitty experience or a fucking mental breakdown. The teacher would always tell me that I have potential, or that my skill is good, but she can't help me because I won't help myself.

I'm not sure if she's a bad teacher or not, but she does make me feel really bad about myself and my work. Hearing her say that I'm behind, or that I have potential but I'm not meeting it, or if I'm really serious about taking art, or basically rejecting me as a student doesn't make me feel more motivated to do my work. She's mentioned that she can kick her students out of the class if she really wanted to, or threatens to call our parents or the principal. Again, doesn't make me feel more motivated only more fucking depressed that I ever took this subject. Many students that have taken this subject under her has also dropped art. It's really affecting my love for art and just makes me feel like burning all my work and dropping the subject all together. But I can't. I only have 6 weeks left to finish 4 preps. I don't know how I'm going to do it. I don't feel like doing it anymore. I took this subject because I fucking love doing art, but this teacher has made it so stressful and to the point where I fucking hate sitting down with my shitty drawings and pencil and just being reminded of how much of a disappointment I am. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if how I feel is justified. I think the teachers are right to say all that about me. It just makes me feel like I'm always not good enough and I'm lacking something others have, or I'm just a lazy piece of shit.

 Sorry for the rant, but if u read till this far, thank you for hearing me out."
what do I do?,"My teacher has been having bad grammar in test questions the entire year. I have been getting these answers wrong because frankly I don't know how to answer. Aswell as some of the answers are just flat out wrong. Take a look at some of my most recent test questions.

( Answers in Green are what he says is correct, blue highlighted is my answer)

(Plz correct me if I am wrong abt all this but I believed that caffeine was the most widely used drug, and Cocaine and crack were stimulants)

Teacher humiliated me over undiagnosed ADHD symptoms,"I just remembered this story and connected what happened as a symptom of ADHD and was immediately angry and needed to share. When I was in sixth grade we were given an English textbook that we had to bring back at the end of the year, like in most classes. Near the end of the year she started asking us to bring them back, and I kept forgetting. I would write it down and everything but I could just never remember to bring it back. I believe I was one of the last students that hadn’t brought it back yet, and she yelled at me in front of the class on multiple occasions and made me go to the office alone and ask them to use the phone so I could call my mom and tell her what I did and ask her to remind me to bring it tomorrow. 

My teacher thought I was being defiant and  irresponsible, and that I needed to be punished for it so that I’d listen to her. 

I wasn’t any of those things. I was in sixth grade. I got an A in her class, despite multiple things being the day in late occasionally due to my forgetfulness. I was a good, quiet student. My chronic forgetfulness was not defiance or irresponsibility and it should have been clear from my past behavior, as well as the fact that I was only 11 years old that it wasn’t. She never bothered to look deeper or be concerned that I never seemed to remember anything, regardless of importance. She ridiculed me for not obeying her and made me think there was something wrong with me. Teachers need to do better at recognizing problems in students and not just assuming they’re defiant and rude when they can’t follow instructions."
My small business teacher has taught us NOTHING since classes started,"I'm in college and my business class is completely online. She has spent weeks not giving us assignments nor grading the ones we turn in. all that's graded is the orientation stuff. Now with about 3 weeks left of class, she's trying to clean up her act. I myself and others have spent money paying for this class and both time and money are being wasted."
"Wearing a""WIRE"" in 3rd Grade to bust my Abusive Teacher!","When you're only 8-9 years old and move to a completely new city and have to start all over again in a new school... the LAST THING you expect to deal with or have to go through is your Teacher bullying you and abusing you!!! 

Unfortunately for me, that is EXACTLY what I had to deal with! A little background for you Redditors to fully appreciate my now very real and unbelievable predicament but not wanting to digress off topic, I was already dealing with my Mothers New meal·ticket, who turned out to be an abusive alcoholic that seemed to absolutely LOVE getting drunk and beating on my 2 sisters and myself! Since I couldn't bear with watching/hearing my sisters get beaten, I often took as much blame as I could in order to save my sisters from a beating! So Obviously I originally had High hopes when I started 3rd Grade at Calf Pen Meadows Elementary in Connecticut. Since I just moved from a dying & depressing one horse town that was in Galion, Ohio! I was incredibly eager to see what city life was going to be like!   Galion was surrounded by Red Neck hill jacks and their never-ending corn fields.😆 So obviously I had high hopes for the people I hoped to befriend, also for the obviously way better schools and my favorite part of it all was living 5 minutes from the beach and that's walking distance!

You can imagine my horror when during my first week in this new school, my new teacher for the entire year singles me out and tears me down in front of the entire class for being a backwards inbred  because I would always write and complete assignments using both hands interchangeably as I am ambidextrous and ALWAYS have been ever since I can remember! I also had a noticeable accent that I'm sure sounded southern which to Easterners, they  automatically perceive this as me being a Dumbass Hillbilly or Country Boy and in turn treat you as just that! So as you can see life is really proving to be a complete Bitch! 

By the time Halloween was approaching my Teacher had simply become a nightmare! I absolutely dreaded EVERY SINGLE DAY of my life! I hated being at home because of the abuse and I equally hated going to school for the same damn reason! This Teacher looked like a tall & anorexic version of Judge Judy! She had a permanent resting bitch face, incredibly bad breath, and these  really long and sharp real finger nails that she would ALWAYS dig as deep into my arms, neck, and shoulders as she could, oftentimes breaking the skin and drawing blood! I told my mom but she didn't believe me at all! Even though I would walk home in tears and ALWAYS arrived home upset and constantly felt helpless and hopeless! I didn't want to report anything to anyone at school for fear of it getting back to my Teacher and my abuse getting worse!!! 

I was enrolled in this class for ""special"" or struggling students about halfway through the school year in February. Which I wasn't stupid or ""special"" but I was absolutely struggling! I finally caught a break when I went to this new class and was always visibly upset when arriving to this new class and NEVER wanting to go back to my normal class with my nightmare of a teacher and would often cry my eyes out when having to go back! My new teacher in this new class is the one who finally believed me AND saw the marks left by the other Teacher. Once she became my voice, my Mom finally realized that I wasnt lying and finally came up with the idea of sending me to school with a tape recorder that I was able to use to finally get the proof I desperately needed of her abusing me and the comments she made in regards to my claims of abuse she was using! 

Which thank God after almost the entire school year I had to deal with this nut job. She was FINALLY fired and had her teaching license revoked along with every benefit she had accumulated ever! 

That was the first of MANY insane issues that I have been forced to accept, endure, & inevitably overcome!!!"
The Worst Teacher I Ever Had - Part 2,"Math was not the only struggle, as I dropped out of Accelerated math after the first term, but ELA was also awful, as I made the bad mistake of not dropping out. BT (Bad Teacher) was even worse there. She would hold up kid's journals and tell the class ""This is what not to do"", she would assign countless projects and either lose them, not grade them, or change the due date at the last minute. For one assignment, she kept adding on requirements every day. On the day before it was due, she forced us to color it, but after that....

She had the audacity to move the due date to the next week. Why?

Because her favorite student forgot to bring hers. Yes, she did play favorites like many teachers, but unlike those many teachers, she was clear about it. 

She would often lie to parents about how she taught. She told them that she would always be available to ask questions about the topic. Wrong. 

The worst part was that she would often forget about the school standards. In my class, she forgot that one of the standards was to write a research paper. She forgot about the research paper until one of the students in my class had the audacity to remind her. She ended up having to rush us. When I was doing my research, she only allowed us to use our County's virtual library, which was not very good, to say the least, and the websites on there were hard to navigate. When I finished my research, she decided to check everyone's notes. She claimed that my notes were ""not on topic"", even though they were, as I checked with my mom. This vile woman then proceeded to THROW MY NOTES IN THE TRASH.

This wasn't the only time she has broken me down into tears. 

Luckily, after my school year ended, my mom was a legend and got the computers out. We both wrote bad reviews about her on a teacher reviewing site (name of site will remain anonymous). Both of our reviews have since been deleted. I have heard bad reviews about her, and it has been about three years since I had her. 

Thank You for Listening to Me Vent,

Why I think Students aren’t Believed when Teachers Mistreat Them,"I think a lot of it comes from the way children are viewed in society.

Child safety advocate Marci Hamilton has pointed out that adults generally prefer and protect adults from abuse. This unfortunately true in the public education setting, because whenever a student complains about a teacher mistreating them, they generally aren’t believed, either by their parents, or school staff. They’re dismissed as “exaggerating” or told to “toughen up”."
The Worst Teacher I Ever Had - Part One,"I've had my fair share of bad teachers. Some were disorganized, some assigned a lot of busy work, and some played favorites and were obvious about it. This woman....was all of the above, but twice as terrible. This is going to be a long one, so buckle your seatbelts!

Note: All names in this story are replaced with fake ones and/or other roles Ex. BT (bad teacher) for confidential reasons.

So here is my story:

So picture this: A 5th grader was excited for the school year. She had both her two best friends (BFF1 and BFF2) in her class and her \*HOMEROOM\* teacher was a nice person and had a massive bucket full of candy in the back of her classroom. 

I was hyped, man.

But not for long. Once I got to school, I realized that because I had the gifted classes, I would be having math and ELA with the bad teacher (BT for short). At first, I liked having class with said teacher. In the first couple of weeks of school, she would barely assign any homework and treat us well. I was excited for this school year!

Oh boy was I wrong...

Just TWO WEEKS after this woman became my teacher, she assigned MOUNTAINS of homework. Like, entire MATH PACKETS for a week. Note that I was in the gifted program, and in the program I left class on Mondays to go to the Gifted Class. So that meant that I only had four days to do a packet. Keep in mind that in 5th grade most kids my age had sports and other activities. We didn't have time to do all this. (And before y'all ask, I went to a public Elementary school, sorry if I sound rude). 

I didn't even mention how she would teach. She would never explain anything correctly, which always resulted into asking my Dad for help on math problems. When he would not understand the work, I'd ask her how to do it. She'd either brush me off with ""Y'all should already know this"", ""Y'all learned this in second grade, y'all should get it now"". The few times she would help me she would be very rude about me not understanding the material. 

I am going to post a second part to this soon. I'm sorry this is so long I need to vent."
Mean teacher,"In high school I had this really really mean teacher and she hated me the most. my mother had passed a few weeks ago and I got really depressed so when I went to class I moped around a lot and didn't feel like talking or answering questions. now she had a big problem with this. she would always yell at me for being lazy and not interacting with the class. I couldn't get mad. I was to sad and knowing that my mother was never gonna come back was the worst. so she thought by asking me questions and knowing that I wouldn't answer them used this to get a free pass to scold me IN front of the class and get away with it. so one day we go through the standard her targeting me and asking questions me not answering them. but then we get to scolding she looked at me in the eyes and said ""This is probably why your mom died I mean if I was her I wouldn't want a disappointment of a child either"" I got so mad and stood up walked to her and called her a jackass in front of the entire class then stormed out while crying. But my actions caught up with me and got suspended  for a week. she then for the rest of the year made it her job to embarrass me when she could. though I still think what I did was correct and if I could go back I probably would have flung more insults at her"
Teacher comes into do testing a week after going into quarantine,Yes you read the title right my teacher came in to do finals a week after being diagnosed with COVID-19 and said it out loud I’m not mad just disappointed
Wierd teachers,So when I was in middle school I had this really weird science teacher. He loved insects. He would always mention this “world renowned” insect biologist who he was great buddies with. If you googled this man no results would pop up. He was around 50 and played clash of clans daily. He was in a clan with some students at our school. He would always say something like “donobetteryamayeanackamall” idk apparently it was Pennsylvanian Dutch. We would try to get him to tell us but to no success. His kids didn’t even know what it meant.
I’m lost at how to address this situation...,"I’m sorry I have to rant about a 300 level UNDERGRAD LAB that I have to take! 

We have 25 minutes to complete a 200 point memorization quiz of 20 plants, 15 new plants and five review plants. Each plant we need to know: common name, tribe, genus, species, origin, and lifespan. If we just so happen to get all of the tribes right he will give us a 20pt bonus. Then during our TWO HOUR lab after we have taken 25 minutes to complete our quiz we “look at the plants” if he isn’t going to assign us anything to do during class while he grades our quizzes why are we here? When we get our quizzes back we can correct them and he gives us 25 points for working in the lab. That’s it. That’s all we get.

The only time we can study in the lab looking at the samples is when the teacher isn’t in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. My problem is he has classes all day Monday and Wednesday when I’m free and Thursdays are hell for me. Our quizzes are on Tuesdays. He won’t leave the lab open on weekends anymore unless he happens to be there.

Most of the students in this particular lab are either failing or dang near failing. Two boys in my section are thinking of dropping this class. Two girls in the section after mine have already done so and one of those girls completely changed her major because of this teacher. I’m not too sure about the section before me but there were a ton of people who dropped before class really began. I’m not sure what I can do. I’m afraid of him retaliating.

Edit to add: he has also previously forced us to wear masks outside while we were plenty separated during our lab. It was 103 degrees out and we were hiking all over. I had four bottles of water and was drinking water but still passed out due to heat. He was nearby and said he thought he saw me pass out. He has also been known to call a student stupid in class to their face."
My professor emailed this to me the day after I spent 2 weeks working on 2 assignments,
OUR CRAZY TEACHER (read all the way through!!),"Hey guys my grade has a lot of people trying to fire one of our teachers. There is lots or reasons why like, she cusses her students out, during a fire drill a few days ago, she sat in the classroom and told the students not to leave they sat there for a minute and then decided to leave. When other teachers outside (like they should be) said it was ok to go back in, the students did. But when they got back in the teacher started yelling at the students saying YOU CAN'T TELL ME HOW TO DO MY JOB. just like she wanted the kids not to listen to the school rules. That's not even all of it. She is our career connections teacher and she asked a student what they what to be when they are older. When she responded the teacher said ""you might as well give up its worthless for YOU to try"" Trying to said you can't do it without actually saying that. And this lady says that this class is an open class to argue, I WANT you to argue. But when students do, she starts yelling at them and says stop this petty crap and go to the office, you have no right to argue with me. LIKE WTF (O_O)?? And there's more but I'm not listing it all. So half of her class skipped her class and went to the office to tell them what she does and she needs to be fired. After a long day of principles ""interviewing"" Students, the principles basically said stay out of it I will deal with her. But she told another student that she (the principal) will make sure she stops cussing her students out. But it she does tell that crazy teacher that the teacher will start yelling at the students the next day abt how they told on her and that is so immature. So that will help nothing. So we are trying to fire this lady but the principles wont. Do you guys have any suggestions of what we should do or something to say bc I'm stuck. ⬆ this post if y'all think that teacher is crazy too."
An Army Brats Tale of the Worst Teachers/Faculty He's Ever Had (Pt 1),"It's been 20-25 years since these incidents and given the age of the individuals involved when this happened, it's fairly safe to say that most if not all of them have retired, so here goes.  


As the dependant of someone in the Military, you move around a lot. From the age of 6 till I graduated I went through 7 schools in four different Provinces and moved 12 times. That's life in the military, if you don't fit in a duffle bag, you're not important and you go where your Military Parent is sent. You're going to see a trend here with some of them, I assure you.

First teacher was in grade 6 in Nova Scotia, my homeroom and English/Social Studies teacher Mr. G. To be honest, he wasn't that good of a teacher, most likely at the end of his career and probably sick of teaching a class of 25-30 pre-teens day in and day out. A real 'phone it home' kind of teacher if there ever was one. His idea of teaching an English class was printing off crossword puzzles and word searches with that week's set of words and left us to our own devices in between reading books that were likely above our reading/age level. 

I was an alright student, got my assignments done and maintained a C/B equiv. average. He was a real stickler for making sure that our 'Planners' (a calendar book that we write our assignments due dates down in) and have our parents initial them. 

My father's job, an Army Signals operator, often required him to go off on training courses, sent to remote radio stations used for communications on the east coast of Canada for repairs etc, and when not doing that, he worked 6 on, 6 off 12-hour shifts on the regular. This was the mid 90's and Canada's military was in the middle of completely switching its communications equipment from Analog (some of it dating to the Korean War) to Digital, and my Father's skillset, along with hundreds of others in his trade, was in high demand and they worked for years to get it done, something that didn't happen till the early 2000s, making Canada the first military in the world to go fully digital.

My mother also worked long hours and often neither of them were home in the evening or morning and my siblings and I were left to take care of ourselves (my older brothers were 16 &17 at the time, so they kept my sister and I, in line). 

So sometimes it wasn't possible for these things to be initialled, and it *HAD* to be my parents. The punishments often involved berating in front of the class, being held back for detention, or sent to the library to copy entire sections of an encyclopedia out by hand. (I have a sneaking suspicion, as I'm writing this, that this was where my carpal tunnel first originated, as I had to do this till my wrist ached)

Nothing I said or explained would suffice for him. 

""Maybe your father should have chosen a different career,"" he once told an 11-year-old boy who held his father in very high esteem.

To make matters worse, I had a severe speech impediment when I was younger, a real bad stutter, and the merciless treatment I got from my fellow students was relentless, to which Mr. G did nothing about.

Come parent/teacher night, my Father, who had gotten off early from his shift was able to attend and had yet to get out of his combat/work uniform. So in my Dad and I walk into his class and sit down.

The first words out of his mouth were: ""I have nothing good to say about your son.""

My father retorted: ""Then you're a piss-poor excuse for a teacher,"" then turned to me and asked if I wanted to go for McDonald's.

And we walked out with Mr G. protesting all the way."
An Army Brats Tale of the Worst Teachers/Faculty He's Ever Had (Pt 3),"Fast forward a couple of years, I had moved twice, once in again in Nova Scotia, and the second to Manitoba and my Father had just been promoted and posted into a Combat unit (2PPCLI).

I'm in Grade 12 and I had gotten Mrs K. for English (seriously, I don't know what it was with English teachers and me... I'm not making this up.)

It was April 29th, 2002 and the Tarnak Farm incident had just happened (Where a US Air Force Reserve Pilot mistakenly bombed a Canadian training exercise in Afganistan, killing 4 and injuring 8 more from 3PPCLI.)

Our assignment was to do a current events essay on the top story at the time. We were handed newspapers and on the cover was a crying girl that I knew from Nova Scotia, and it dawned on me then and there, I knew one of the people who had been killed and went to school with his sister (the girl in question).

I told Mrs. K that I couldn't do the assignment, I told her why (it was too close to home) and that I don't feel comfortable with it, especially with my Dad's unit gearing up for deployment to Afghanistan.

She told me to either do the assignment or get a failing grade for it.

There was something in her voice, the way she said it, almost like disgust or disdain, and it rubbed me the wrong way. So I told her ""Fine by me."" and I walked out.

This was the start of her really taking a dislike to me. She made it quite clear with her remarks, choice in teaching subjects, books picked for book reports, etc. that she did not like the Military or that Canada was engaged in combat overseas, and she took her dislike/frustration out on me, a hapless 17-year-old (at the time, I would turn 18 two months later), for something totally out of his control.

She would intentionally fail me on projects, saying that I hadn't done enough, or that I hadn't followed the assignment instructions, whatever.

The final straw was her failing me on one of the largest assignments of the year, it accounted for half of our grade. We were to write a Fictional story, the subject didn't matter (she was quite explicit on this). Had to be 5000 words or more, complete with character bios, world synopsis, the works.

My grandmother is a published author, and she was living with us at the time and I asked her for advice and she told me to ""Write what you know,"".

So I wrote a Star Trek Fan-Fiction. Completely original characters, setting, scenario. In total, I wrote close to 10,000 words.

I followed the instructions for the assignment to the letter.

She failed me because what I had written wasn't entirely original.

She had let it slip that I had failed to one of my friends in class, who told me before I saw her that day, and I ran into her in front of the Principal's office, which was in the main foyer of the school, with dozens of students walking about, and I was incensed and started yelling at her to explain what the hell was going on. This turned into quite the scene.

I had spent two months working on that project, she knew what I was writing and not once did she mention that.

The Principal came out of his office and tried his best to mediate the situation. He asked me what was going on, and I told him ""This military hating bitch has had it out for me all year ever since she found out that my father was CAF, and she just failed me on a final project on a technicality she could have warned me about months ago.""

Mrs. K chimed in that if I continued to talk about her in that way, she would call my parents.

""The hell you will, I'm 18, if you have a problem with me, take it up with me, my father's about to be deployed and I will not subject him to the likes of you.""

She looked at the Principal with a stunned look on her face as if to ask 'what now' and he told her ""Don't look at me, he's right, he's an adult.""

The Principal took us into the office to get away from the crowd that had gathered and discuss the matter. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't get the grade overturned, as 'technically' she was right, the fact that she could have remedied this almost immediately when the assignment began notwithstanding. The principal agreed with me that she intentionally did this, and he would deal with that.

Angry, I told him, ""Then I'm done with this bitch, keep her away from me, I don't care if I fail her class."" and walked out.

I never went back to her class after that.

I did wind up failing English, which meant that I did not graduate (I was a credit short, English being required), and I had to repeat a semester of English the following year.

Thankfully, I got the best teacher I had ever had in my life, Mrs. N. Her teaching style, how she treated everyone with respect, everything. The short time I spent in her class honestly changed my life, a lot of my outlook on life, how I treat others, my work ethic, everything, I owe to her.

I wouldn't be the man I am today if it wasn't for her guiding influence

I still keep in contact with her today and every October 5th, Teacher's Day in Canada, I send her flowers, been doing that for almost 20 years."
n Army Brats Tale of the Worst Teachers/Faculty He's Ever Had (Pt 2),"It's been 20-25 years since these incidents and given the age of the individuals involved when this happened, it's fairly safe to say that most if not all of them have retired, so here goes. 

Part 2  


A few years later, grade 8 in Junior High, and I'm assigned to Mrs. V's homeroom and had her for English. 

Mrs. V was also in the last part of her Career. She had come down from the nearby High School and was about 2 years from retirement. Probably thought teaching a younger class would be easier.

To be perfectly honest, I have absolutely no idea what I did to get her to hate me, and I don't say that lightly.

By this point, I was well established as the class nerd. Hard Core Trek fan, always doodling in my books, and still stuck with a stutter that made me stick out in class. While not as relentless as the years prior (different school, older age group), it was still there, and again, the teacher did nothing about it.

In fact, she did things that made it worse. For whatever reason, she arranged all the desks in a U shape on the edge of the classroom and had my desk in the center of the class. I shouldn't have to explain how morally degrading this was. There were a few occasions where when she left the room the rest of the class would throw things at me until she returned where she'd tell them to settle down and carry on as nothing happened.

All of this contributed to failing grades, depression and outright skipping school just to get away from it all.

This carried on for at least 6 months (no, my parents weren't aware because I didn't tell them, kid being a kid and all). 

When my parents got my mid-year report card, they demanded to know what was going on, as all my other grades were just fine, and were doubly confused because at this point in my school career I had very high English grades, going from normal 85% average to low 30s.

I told them everything.

They demanded to speak to Mrs. V. and have the Principal present, and we all met in her classroom after school.

My parents railed into Mrs. V in a typical protective parent way, for very justifiable reasons. They demanded to know why my desk was where it was (She said it would toughen me up), why she did nothing to stop the torment their son was under (She said they're old enough to sort these things out themselves).

I sat there and watch as she tried to defend her actions, the Principal's face getting redder with anger as the meeting went on.

It was then that I noticed that the TV was still in the corner of the room, so I got up and got the VHS tape out of the VCR and handed it to the Principal, and his jaw dropped.

""She showed us this in English class this afternoon,"" I told him.

It was a copy of ""Schindler's List"", unedited, and she let a class of 13-14 year old's watch a graphic, rated R movie, complete with excessive violence and at least one scene of explicit sexuality. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.

Now, my mother doesn't swear all that often, so to hear her say ""What the fuck!"" loud enough to be heard form the hall and have another teacher passing by stick her head in to see what was going on, was pretty jarring.

Mrs. V was quietly put on administrative leave and never returned opting to retire early, with a Substitute teacher finishing out the year.

This next one is quick and funny:

The following year we moved to another part of Nova Scotia, and I was in Grade 9 in a different school.

When coming out of class, another student who I didn't know or had any class with, sucker-punched me in the hall, giving me quite the black eye.

My mother was out of town visiting family and that left my Dad, who was called in from work (remember my Dad was Active Duty military, so this is a BIG deal, but my Dad's Warrant was a chill dude and family friend to this day) to handle the situation.

I was sitting in the principal's office and in comes my Dad, his work uniform covered in grease and smelling like diesel fuel (he had been maintaining some utility generators at work), takes one look at me and ignores the Principal was trying to greet him, to ask me what happened, and I told him.

The Principal immediately protested and said that wasn't what he was told what happened, as if my version of the story wasn't good enough, to which my Dad responds:

""Do you not know what happens in your own school?""

And the Principal responds:

""I am sick and tired of people telling me that I don't know what's going on in my school!""

My dad and I left immediately. 

We got a phone call later that day saying that despite the circumstances, the school's zero-tolerance policy on violence meant that I was suspended for a week."
Bad Grading System,"I am in the class of my teacher with the horrible grading system. On my first day, teacher was nice and assigned once a week. Then a few weeks later, she assigns 2 assignments every night. Good. Then a quiz every week, and 2 assignments. Okay. Then notes, quiz, and 2 assignments. This was fine. Then assignments got harder and not showing work took away 30 points. Unfair but I dealt with it. Then not showing work was 50 points, now she is threatening to take away all points. Workload now: Notes that are graded as tests, a quiz every week, an assignment throughout the week every week, 2 assignments, and 30 or 50 points taken for no work. We all liked the teacher and at first considered her nice. Now we all hate her and before every Social Studies class we discuss how much we hate her :). Also at this time, my friend and I are discussing trapping her in a room with an eel (she hates them) to see if she would pass out. If she does, we can sneak in and just kidnap her. Of course we are joking, though. I am, at least. Don't know if my friend is..."
Did this happen to anyone else,
4th Grade Math Class,"I’m not great at math, actually If it’s above simple algebra I’ll probably have to phone a friend. This is bad because I am a Computer Science minor and love programming. 

Well after a few weeks of the semester, my intro class began using greater than/less than symbols to work with programs and actually program. This sent me into full blown panic because I have gotten so confused with the symbols since my 4th grade teacher taught me a stupid way of reading it. I actually remember the day we learned it and failing that homework. 

So here I am… sophomore in college who doesn’t know how to do some basic math. Luckily I googled the hell to remember and relearn and it is now engrained in my head.

Not an amazing story, but it screwed up my life for many years. 

I have better teacher stories and I’ll post about them eventually… let’s just say college has its gems and it’s turds."
I'm about to fail my English class for the year and my teacher refuses to help me.," 

I'm in English honors 11 and I'm at risk for failing the year. I have tried so hard to do the work but I can't. I literally cannot do the work without having a mental breakdown/meltdown. Due to me being ""emotionally disabled"" (<--- that's how the school defined me as) I have an IEP. My IEP say that I can turn at least 50% of completed work.

(Ex. 20 problems on math hw, I would be required to do min. 10 problems, if I got 80% of them right, I get 80% as my score).

I NEED this accommodation as to not overwhelm myself. I tried to do my English homework, even though my brain said ""if you do it, you are going to have a meltdown"", I ignored it to try to pass the class. I ended having 6 panic attacks/meltdowns. But I ended up getting at least 50% of it done, which what is required of me, so I turned that in.

(This part happened yesterday) He didn't give full credit for it and told I had to complete it. When I reminded him about my IEP (I WAS STILL IN CLASS) instead of talking to me about it, he decided to email my dad.

My dad was at home with me at the time (I'm doing online schooling) and showed me the email. It was saying that she doesn't turn any of her work, that she's lying about what her IEP says, I've tried to help her, but she's not trying, etc.

I waited until after class to talk to him and tell him what they told me at the IEP meeting, this is what happen next (not verbatim)

Him: ""It doesn't say that""

Me: ""that's what they told me at the meeting""

Him: ""It doesn't say that""

Me: ""Well it's implied that you grade as if it's 100% done. It doesn't makes sense that my accommodation is I do 50% of the work and 50% of of the credit, how is that helping me?""

Him: ""well I don't know""

Me: ""None of my other teachers had a problem with it, why do you? I'm trying my hardest (I am now crying at this point)

Him: ""No you're not""

Me: ""I get that I didn't turn in my other assignments, but I turned in this one, I'm using one of my accommodations. I've had several panic attacks and mental breakdowns, please""

Him: ""I'm not going to do that""

Now at this point I hang up, which was rude of me I'll admit, but I was PISSED. I told my parents and older brother about this (he also has an IEP, so they all know how it works) about it. My brother told my parents ""that's illegal"" we looked it up and yeah. My IEP is a legal document designed to help me, my teacher just can't do what he wants, he has to follow my IEP. My mom wrote him an email last night. We'll see how that goes

My prediction is that he'll say ""She doesn't turn in her work, the work she turns in is not completed, I've given her more time, but she doesn't do it""

I feel like I should mention this: One of my other accommodations is extended time, but that's not what I need in this situation, he said that he is willing to provide any accommodation to help me, even though when I asked for different assignments, he said no, I wanted to use my 50% accommodation, he said no. He is only willing to provide more time.

What y'all think of this situation?"
A story about me back in Middle school,
Teacher ridicules me for having low grade,"Back in seventh grade i had an english teacher that didn't make learning fun it almost seemed like a chore, in her class it wasn't about learning it was about passing. Anyway one day i walked up to her during class already in a bad mood and asked

ME: Hey Ms. Teacher, can i talk to you about my grade?

Teacher: yes (looks at grades) wow your grades are really bad i expected better from you

Me: yes that's why im here because you haven't graded any if my assignments.

(When i say she didn't grade any assignments i mean she didn't grade assignments from the first days of school.)

Teacher: (looks up at me) well ill grade somethings to make your grade go up

Me: (in a passive aggressive voice) thank you

She proceeded to grade nothing and i had to talk to her again, and when she graded things it seemed very random like she graded things by her way not by how she actually has to do it she also gave us impossible deadlines and was bitter when things didn't go her way, if i have an assignment worth 50 points get 50/50 and my grade would go up by .5% (im not exaggerating) and if i had gotten 49/50 my grade would almost go down a whole letter grade.

EDIT: she wanted things her ways (example: me and a friend are messing around in her class and she gets mad and wants us to switch seats so i mentioned that we finished so she checks and gets so mad and says "" ok i still want you to switch seats"" keep in mind some kids are literally running around the class and most haven't even started the work. Even if we arent talking and working she would split us up. Fuck that teacher almost bombed that class"
teacher gets mad at a foreign girl for mispronouncing a word.,"Not my story. it's my friend's story that she said I should put. I don't know if it's true but I'm going to post it anyway.  When it said I and we and such this story is from her perspective. 

from my friends perspective:

There was this girl in one of my classes in middle school. She had just come to America on I think a school visa or something. She spoke English but it wasn't the best. I wasn't friends with her or anything but I was behind her in line and in the class when both events happened.  We were in the lunch line. our school sold soda cans at lunch. This girl who I will name Misha(not her actual name) says to the cashier ""I would like a coke"" but instead of coke, she said a word starting with c that can be used as another name for male genitalia. We all know what she meant so no one said anything. She gets her coke and walks away. We get back to class, she sets her drink down and pulls out paper for the class. The teacher walks in and does her usual attendance check and she gets to the girl's name. She can't pronounce her name. She's trying to say it but can't. She looks at the girl and asks her name. Misha says her name and they move on. At the end of attendance, she points at Misha. The teacher says ""YOU. whatever your name is, what's that on your desk?"" Misha says "" thats my coke."" but said the same way as earlier. the teacher asked her to repeat and Misha says it again. The teacher gets this disgusted look on her face and says "" YOU, the little girl is gross. That is a coke. You are a lady you should not have male genitalia, especially in my classroom. and you have been in America for a month. you should be able to say coke correctly. I'm going to solve your issues. Instead of, however, you say your name, It is now Sam in my class. And you WILL lose that accent in my classroom."" She proceeds to make stereotypes about her and call her many many slurs at her. And then she calls the principal to ""remove a disrupting child"" The principal gets there. He asks what has happened and she said ""THis girl here,(walks to her and tells her to get up) brought a beverage into my classroom calling it (male genitalia name here) saying she has one. I've already disciplined SAM. I've given her an American name and have told her to not use her accent in my classroom. all I need you to do is take her out of my classroom, These children are here to learn and not see her drinking and speaking on her male genitalia, Disgusting animal. (looks at Misha) I hope God will save your sinning soul, (insert racial slur here)"" The look on the Principles face was great. Turns out the principal was a relative of the girl and she was staying with him while in America. She was fired not long after that. Misha's last words to this woman were ""My name is Misha (middle name last name) not Sam, monkey(said in a different language)"" I looked up what she meant After class. To clarify, She was describing what this woman looked like. it wasn't about her race. This woman had big ears and some of her features did make her look like a monkey. I promise she didn't mean it about her race. 

As I said I don't know if my friend's story is real. I think She saw the video of the Asian woman sating coke but the way stated above and made up a story. But she really wanted to post on Reddit. Misha is a real person, not her actual name but she is a real person. Her moving to america and such is real. her living with the principal is real but This story is something only my friend remembers. so I don't know"
Teacher gets mad at her students for no reason,"Someone told me this subreddit is perfect for my story so I'm gonna share it there as well;

 

So,

This happened this morning and I want to write it down before I forget it.

I'm an high school student, me and my class had to organize some groups for a phisical education oral test (yes, phisical education).

This was not the first time we were asked to decide the groups so we were pretty used to it, and we always made groups of five pepole for each hour and our teacher has always been fine with that(remember it because this will be important later on).

Today during online class my classmate shared the list of the groups on google classroom so my teacher could see it and know who to call the for the test next lession.

Apart from the fact that she didn't know how to refresh the page to see my classmate's list and got mad at us because she tought we were making fun of her, when we finally managed to make her see the list she lost it for some reason.

She said in a very rude tone that she wanted only four people in each group.  
Problem is that if we only put 4 people in each group we would have to occupy a third week (we are 20 students, and we have 2 hours of PE each week) in wich we already occupied dates for other subjects (wich are all waaay more important than PE)

We tried to explain her that, but she started SCREAMING that we HAD to do 4 pepole each turn,  
sadly we can't do anything about that, because the school dosen't have any regulations about how close two tests can be; the only thing it says is that there can't be 2 WRITTEN tests the same day.

And so now my classmates who have their turn in the third week will have to take some days from studying important subjects like math or physics and will have to waste time to study PE.

Stay safe everyone, have a nice day.<3"
My shitty French teacher,"Okay so as you can guess I’m Canadian and I’ve had and still am having trouble with French I am getting better at it but that’s not the point.

my French teacher for grades 3-4 who I will passionately call “mme merd” when I was in her class would teach one subject until her “favourites” (the ones who understood French and spoke it) understood the lesson then carried on she wouldn’t even ask the rest of the class if they understood (at least that’s what my sister told me).

The only real reason I’m typing this though is because when I was in her class I would speak very little French but get this,
I was one of the only people in the class who passed almost every test (mostly because of my tutor who was extremely nice and helped me out tremendously) but when I got my report card at the end of the year my mom was pissed for 2 reasons.

Reason 1. The principal didn’t tell the French teacher to give me different sheets.

Reason 2. Mme merd didn’t pass me because I didn’t speak much French as the other kids.

                                 
YA SEE THIS SHIT ⬆️ “because I didn’t speak as much French as the other kids”, hmm I wonder why?

But here is the real kicker it took till the third term of that year for her to have 1 on 1s with the students who were struggling.


Thanks for reading have a nice day.

Edit: forgot to mention that I only know most of this from my mother and sister so it might not completely correct"
My teacher punish me for leaving lunch hours in time!,"Hello my name is Oliver and i have the worst teacher ever. A KAREN, she is always angry and strict for no reasons and she hates all students that isnt good in her eyes. So me and my friends is in the group that she hates and we sit nex to her when we eat. We have located places in the dining room and she sits next to us. So my friend has a smart watch and can see the digital time and my teacher dont have a phone or a smart watch. She looks at the big clock in the dining room. The clock is like 10 minuts wrong and all staff knows that. Every teacher knows that except Karen. So when my friend looks at his clock and sees whe can o awa from the dining room whe do. But karen looks att the big clock and runs ater us and yelles at us for planing to go out when we in her eyes could not. While she is yelling the rest of the class also goes out and she dosn""t yell at them but only at us. I dont know wat to do. Switch school, switch class or get the priniple involved Idk. Help pls!"
Dumb professor,
When I was a kid a teacher told me that trees changed colour at night and light had nothing to do with it.,"So this teacher in middle school science told our class “at night the leaves on the trees change to a darker shade of green.” I raised my hand and asked “is that to do with the amount of light hitting your eyes being different at night than in the day” she replied, telling me that wasn’t the case, that they actually physically changed their colour on a chemical level, and that I was wrong. I was smart enough at that age to know that I was right and I asked again “are you sure,” and then the whole class, basically unanimously said “she’s the teacher Nick, she knows better, just stop talking.” And then without skipping a beat the teacher continued with her lesson.... this same teacher once also told our class “the Renaissance is boring, so we don’t need to spend a lot of time on it.” I hated her haha"
Students (or former students) what's the worst thing a Teacher or Professor has ever said or done to you?,I'll start: One teacher told me I was a disappointment to my parents.. OOF
My teacher doesn't understand quarintined?,Just a couple of days ago I am positive with covid. I am quarintines and everything. Clearly I am missing out on school cause of that. So I dont understand most of the lessons. Just today my TEACHER SENT ME AN EMAIL SAYING I HAVE MISSING WORK AND IDK MOST OF EM CAUSE IM QUARINTINED. just now my mom sent me a pissed email. Now idk what to do cause im in stress. And tbh my teacher should take that blame.
"teacher didn't believe that students can do her work, got principal to call parents during work times","So here's what happened: there was a project that was due last Friday some odd 20 kids didn't do it for whatever reason. So to make sure that students didn't get bad grades she made a make-up assignment which sounds nice and it was but here's were it gets bad, she told all of the kids that the make-up was due this Friday aka today then she went and made a list of some of the 20 kids that got the make-up. Now here is the real problem, she gave the list she made to the principal to call the kids that where on the list to tell parents that not only the kid was late turning in the assignment, on the day BEFORE the assignment was due, she also was to say that the kid was going to fail the grade which is untrue. But here is what pissed me off the most was that the teacher told the principal that she was only doing all this because she thought that non of the kids had the smarts to do the assignment and wanted to get the kids in trouble with parents.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: teacher was making shit with parents because she thinks we're stupid"
"A Teacher's Cruel Prank, Classmates Helped","This is an incident that happened to me during my sixth grade year (U.S.), so I was 11 years old when it occurred. It was a ""prank"" that a teacher pulled on me and somehow seemingly got the whole class involved.

I've always been a little, well, different, in a not-neurotypical kind of way - but where I grew up autism/Asperger's wasn't a thing that the school system couldn't bully out of you with enough effort (and so we were never tested for it, either).

I did my best to fit in, but when you're reading about Russian history and Bismarck's lesser German unification in your spare time while the other kids only care about sports or clothes, it isn't easy, especially when there really wasn't anyone like me at all in the very rural area where we lived.

One afternoon that January, the class got into some discussion as to where we thought we'd be in 20 years or something along those lines. I made some remark about probably being off in a cave somewhere, alone, plotting to take over the world (an in-joke that the couple of friends I had in that class thought was hilarious). Of course, some of the ""normals"" made some kind of remark about me finding a special someone someday that would change that. Me being me, I responded with a remark that I'd be trying to run off anyone that even was interested because I was just too weird, to save them the frustration. 

So when Valentine's Day rolled around, I found a tin of chocolates with a note attached on my desk. I had finally convinced my parents (mother mostly) that year that I didn't need to hand out valentines to the whole class, just a select few - I'd just use the leftovers from my siblings' boxes to give them to my friends (saving money was always the magic word). If seeing this tin of chocolates was a surprise, the note inside was a shock - it was presumably from some fourth-grader who had a crush on me. 

I sat and stewed over this all day, but to say I felt a disturbance in The Force was an understatement. On the one hand, I'd never done anything to encourage that kind of behavior; on the other, if it was a prank, I knew I wasn't prepared to handle it.

That afternoon, we had the typical classroom party the elementary classes have for such candy-fueled events. There were a number of activities, and various comparisons of who got the biggest haul. I just kept my head down and stayed quiet.

And then the teacher asked me if I had anything to add. I said, not really. To which she responded, ""Oh come on, we all know about the note you got this morning!""

At that instant, one of the teacher's pets snatched the tin off my desk and read the letter out loud. The whole classroom was giggling or laughing. 

I was mortified.

I don't remember much specifically from that class period, it's a blur. I remember there was an ""everyone point and laugh at the weird kid"" moment, and then we went home. I dumped the candy into a bowl in the kitchen and never ate any of it. 

The tin, which was quite nice, was too big to throw away without it being obvious, so I hid it in my chest-of-drawers. When we moved to the country a couple of years later, I threw it on the burn pile one night after clearing brush. But I've never forgotten the vintage ad that was on the lid.

When my SO brought home a refrigerator magnet with that design on it, I had to tell them this whole story, the first time I'd spoken of it since. 

At least now they understand part of why I haven't gone to a single class reunion."
What was something that a teacher did to belittle or embarrass you in front of the whole class?,"I will start with my experience. I at the time was a freshmen in high school with very poor grades due to it being a rough year for me (personal family issues etc). I had an Algebra I teacher who Absolutely hated me for no particular reason aside from the fact that I struggled with her class, One day near the end of the school day I was sitting in her class minding my own business when she came up to me. My grade card was in her hand and as she slammed it on the table she proceeded to yell at me for having low grades and claiming that I never tried in her class. My grades where low because I have a severe learning disability in Math that requires an IEP and special exceptions when learning anything involving math. This Algebra teacher was refusing to comply with anything on my IEP despite me coming to her about struggling. Her yelling was rather loud and so I snapped and an argument broke out and I had to tell her I was failing because she refused to comply with the IEP, me snapping back ended up with me being sent to the Principals office and given detention for arguing with the teacher. I decided to pass her class out of spite and ended up passing with a C just to prove her wrong. (she has now been fired due to the way she treated her students.)"
What my headmaster did to me,"Let me just start by saying I wasn't the best behaved kid. I was on the spectrum and was in a school full of teachers who were fairly new to the concept of autism. This was when I was 9. I kept being called to the headmasters office, and what he did in there still makes me uncomfortable. He told me that I'm never going to behave, so he was going to do something about it. He told me to stand in the corner and not look at him. Then, he started making grunting noises, like a monster. I looked at him and he told me to turn back around. Then he did it again, and then again, I started getting scared. He started walking over to the corner whilst making the noise. By the time he got there I started to cry. He then yelled at me to leave his office. I left weeping. I sat in the school yard on my own bawling my eyes out. One of the really sweet, younger, less powerful teachers came over and comforted me, asking me why I was crying. I didn't have the brain capacity to tell him what had just happened, but he still stayed with me anyway until I'd calmed down. I still couldn't tell him. This corner thing happened everytime I got into serious trouble. So twice. Then, the last time I was in the heads office he'd about had enough. He said to me: ""I know you don't like it when I become a monster, but you keep being naughty. You never learn."" Then he stood up, towering above me, and said in a growling voice: ""And I am getting ANGRIER, AND ANGRIER. I'M TURNING BACK."" I never even had the capacity to tell my parents back then. Obviously, I tell them about it now, but it was a long time ago, so I don't 100% know if they believe me."
I'm kept in school prision cell for no reason,"So when I was in 5th grade I was diagnosed with sevear adhd and my school knew this. Every morning I would take my medication before going to school(so that I could focus. I had no behavioural issues). One day I forgot to take my medication. When I get to school I remember right about after the second class and I hadn't done anything wrong or bad and I wasn't getting distracted. But I tell my teacher. (I didn't like my teacher. She was mean sexsist and over all a pettie bitch)she angrily sends me to the principals office. There i am yelled at by the principal. Then she sends me to the office lady. Who is absolutely clueless about adhd and its effects. So her best idea is to send me to a blank room with a chair and nothing else. I am left there for the whole day no one to talk to no work to do no entertainment or activities. I wasn't even allowed to eat lunch. And its not like they forgot about me I asked multiple times for something to do politely. I even explained what adhd was and she didn't care. I was 12 with severe adhd, unmedicated, in a blank room, with no communication,work, activities, food, water for six hours!. It felt like torture!"
The worst teacher I’ve had by far,"I posted this a couple days ago but I’ve added and changed a couple things

So in 5th grade, me and most of my friends were in a class and we had the scariest/strictest teacher at school. One day we were putting probability on a number line from impossible to definitely. A few examples were; I most likely will not will not win the lottery today or I will definitely have dinner today etc. Well one of my friends (at this time it was around October-November and her birthday is in December. She puts up her hand and says I will definitely have my birthday this year. He asks when it is and she says December. ALL HE DOES IS GO ”uhhh, you could die” TO AN 11 YEAR OLD. Her best friend burst out crying and that dick head told her to stop being babies.He would always treat people who were smarter with more respect and would often do things like this but the thing is, all the students who saw it, their parents reported it. That means around 27 reports of a teacher telling the student she would die. The principal, who is nice still did nothing and every year at that school the teachers would get a best teacher award and the principal gave it to him every year. Even once he through a white board at someone. It meant to hit the person next to me but instead hit me right in the shin. Anyways, she wasn’t the smartest and would say things like that but went way too far that time. Everyone there was either 10 or 11 and he would treat us like traitors in the army. when he found out we had told the principal and that he got away with it, he only got worse. He would do things like hit us in the heads and if we went to the bathrooms more that twice a day(even with someone on their period) he would give them F’s. He was by far the worst teacher I’ve had. Keep in mind he is not old and thinks to when that was “reasonable“, he was 30 at the time."
the bad racist teacher,"she told me that a test that would basically pave my whole middle school/high school was not a problem, and it will be fine if I would fail it, because it is a practice, turns out, it was for me to be able to get honors, and advanced classes to be able to finish high school a Whole fking year early, and she scolded me for making a paper airplane, when a kid literally threw a scissor right by her head, trying to get a fly, and guess what he didn’t get in trouble, she was also known for being racist, this is experienced first hand, because I was a person of color, while the kid who threw the scissor was white. she was on tenure, so yea f that teacher. there have only been 2 instances where this didn’t count, because she is fine with all people of color that have a’s, but i had a b+, a fkin b+, because it brought her class average up she was fine with the a student, so she got a bonus"
English Teacher Doesn't Understand English,
We all hated him,"PalmTree- bad teacher

T - student who gets kicked out

SC- counselor

So,  this is about a man that was once a teacher but, at the time was a sub,  this happened during the 5th grade. My regular homeroom teacher is also  the math teacher.

During homeroom PalmTree  wasn't there yet instead a person from the main office was there. We  ate breakfast ate talked a bit too loudly. Then homeroom ended. I hadn't  seen the substitute yet but, I've heard from the other classes that  it's PalmTree.

It's  time for math class I enter the room take my seat. The first thing he  did was tell T to change seats after T talked out of turn a few times.  Then T was asking for help with a math problem and was talking to the  person next him. PalmTree told him to get out.

T  tried to defend his actions but failed. Some others tried to defend T  too but, also got yelled at and went back to being silent. T kicked his  seat walked out to the office.  PalmTree then yelled at the boy who was talking to T, to pick up the chair and not to talk again. The class just muttered and starred.

I  tried to learn but he wrote too fast and the way he explained things  were confusing so I settled for keeping up with notes. Then ring ring ring it was a lockdown drill.

PalmTree: What’s this?

Class: It’s a lockdown, were supposed to (a mix of voices all telling him to do the same thing)

PalmTree: You what are we supposed to do

Pointing at a random student.

She basically said: Usually  when you do this drill your supposed to sit against the wall, turn of  the lights, and be silent until a teacher or main office worker opens  the door and says were clear

PalmTree  shook his head obviously not wanting to do this. We kept on talking. he  started screaming he just went off about how disrespectful we were, how  he’ll never want to sub for this class again.

Class: Lost of muttering how we don’t him to sub either

One brave student: We don’t want to you to be our sub either!

PalmTree  then went off on them and started yelling at the student to get out.  Needless to say, that student got out without saying a word. He then was  suddenly calm which might have made us more tense.

A person from the office came in to say the lockdown was over, the counselor.

 I’ve  never like any of my school counselors, that’s probably because I’m  good at telling when a person is lying based on the pitch of their voice  and what not. Counselors always keep the same lying tone as if there  carefully picking their works.

SC took PalmTree outside and then SC went in she wrote everyone’s name who was talking according to PalmTree.

One  girl who’s quiet and hadn’t said word just glared, she was a good  student got good grades, but no snitch, you could tell she was on the  verge of tears because she had never gotten in trouble before. After  that class was over and we didn’t have to deal with him. At the end of  the day when it was time for homeroom again. We just stayed in a  classroom with a different teacher.

The students who got their names written down or kicked out we were supposed to stay in for recess. The teacher let them out halfway cause they got the full story from the kids. He never subbed for our class again."
We all hated him,"We all hated this substitute he was at one point a teacher but, now he just subs. Here are some of the things he did when he subbed.

He took out his dentures when were eating in, 1st grade.

Talked about how his brother died to, 1st graders.

He  told everyone they didn't have to stay in for recess when he had  threatened it but, then after recess we were supposed to go, 3rd grade.

He yelled at a student trying to help him understand what he was supposed to do with the drill going on, 5th grade.

He wrote fast and didn't give us time to take notes, and only his way was the right way."
College Professor Freaks Out on Deaf Student for Not Answering Fast Enough,
7th grade math teacher was a jerk,"My 7th grade Math teacher Miss. B was one of the worst math teachers I’ve had. She was a radical feminist, and extremely religious. She always chose favorites, one kid went to her church and always got a 4 (my school had a weird grading system where a 3-4 was passing and a 1-2 was failing) and the girls in the class always got extensive help, lots of praise, and good grades. Me and two of my friends on the other hand, were belittled and insulted every time we needed help or got an answer wrong. This resulted in us 3 failing the class. I always got detention with her for dumb reasons like forgetting a pencil, or literally just getting a little tear on a paper. During detention she would give us lectures about toxic masculinity and all that bs instead of letting us do our work. Sadly I am still yet to hear of any karma from the freshmen in my high school."

All of us(our friend group) burst out crying and that dick head tells us to stop being babies."
Disgusting public school teachers say what they ACTUALLY think.,
I just really don’t like my science teachers,"This is my first post and I hate that it’s a rant to the vast sea of people of the internet, but I’m tired of hearing “just get over it” “you’re probably just overthinking” or “well maybe you’re just being too enthusiastic” because no mother I’m not over enthusiastic I’m just a better student than everyone in my family combined.

Okay for some background, I’ve always been a really enthusiastic student when it comes to science, it’s my favourite subject and so far I’ve had wonderful teachers.

Until I moved schools a few weeks ago.

I’m in year 9, so first year of high school, and so far all my teachers have been pretty good. They’re nice, they give out opportunities for different people, and they’re just good at teaching, yet the same can’t be said for my science teachers.

I have two science teachers, both of them don’t teach me anything and are incredibly biased, but I’m more spiteful towards one of them. This guy seriously, he’s so obviously biased towards a specific few people it’s not even funny anymore. He also seems to be especially irritated by everything I do. 


On my second lesson, not once was I able to finish answering a question without him interrupting me to go to another person, specifically that one girl that keeps answering, as well as not listening to me when I was explaining my point then telling me “you’re only getting one out of two marks because you didn’t explain” and yes I’m very proud that I yelled “this is because” for the second time in the most passive aggressive tone I could muster. I was really fed up by it, but I put up with it. The next lesson, I was yelled at for “not writing down the questions” on my sheet when I told him I was finished with my work. He never said we were required to do that. So far he hasn’t had us conduct any experiments on our topic, has only used YouTube videos to teach, and hasn’t explained anything to the class. He just expects us to know and understand everything he’s about to teach us. Just a few lessons ago, he asked the class a question and picked on me to answer. When I was done explaining, he flat out says “but you didn’t answer my question at all, that’s not what I’m looking for.” You’ll have to take my word for it that he just asked me what the immune system was in terms of the third line of defence and I answered accordingly. Then he picks on another student and this dude says the exact same fucking thing and somehow earns a “that’s very well explained, it’s the same thing is what she said before, but can you make it simpler?”

.

What the hell do you want from my answer then????? How is it that you just flat out tell me I’m wrong without any acknowledge for my effort and then go ahead and praise someone else for saying the same thing????

Man this teacher managed to make me not want to go to science class in the span of 4 weeks. I rarely put my hand up so I don’t get embarrassed in front of everyone and I don’t ask any questions. I’ve just resorted to doing everything through the internet for the sole reason to avoid any negative interaction with this teacher. I sure as hell hope that I get a new one next year.

And if he ends up writing that I have a bad learning attitude in class on my report card I’m gonna kill someone I swear.

Anyways if you’re reading this thanks for sticking around here have a cookie🍪"
Teacher grades pretests,"My math teacher in 6th grade would always assign a pre-test at the beginning of a unit, which I’m pretty sure is a fairly normal thing. She said she used them to find out our background knowledge on the unit so she could give us different assignments if necessary. The problem was that she would put these pretest scores in the gradebook as a test, and since tests accounted for 90% of our grade, these could seriously crush a kid’s score. She was grading kids on things they’d never learned before, and essentially guaranteeing that most of the class would start a quarter with a C or a B in her class."
Teacher not understanding personal space,Once when i was doing work at school one of my teachers just walked upp to me and wanted to look at how good im working but did not say anything but instead she took my hat and just pulled my head back to look. Never got close to them again
Teacher tries to teach us customer service... using a story about how she got an employee fired for no reason.,"I first posted this story over on r/EntitledPeople but someone suggested I do it here as well. A couple  years ago, I was taking a course for baking. This course is meant to prepare you for a job, so a bit of marketing, teamwork and customer service was included. So our teacher for customer service came in and used this story to teach us. Since the story came from her, some details may have even been twisted in her favor. I have no clue how long ago this happened.

 

K: Karen E: Employee M: Manager.

K walks into a clothes store in a large mall, and goes up to a counter, where E was. On the wall behind E, there are a bunch of clothes exposed for sale.

E: Hello, how may I help you?

K: Hello, I'd like that jacket over there.

K then points to the wall where it was. E looks at it and notices it was far too small for K.

E: Alright! Though, we do only have that size, so-

K: Did I say I wanted another size? I want that jacket.

E: Uh, ok, I just thought-

K: You didn't think anything. If I say I want something, you bring it. You're not supposed to question it. Does your manager really support this kind of customer service?

The bad thing was, K really did know M. So right after that exchange, K just left without even getting her jacket, and met up with M. The two have a friendly talk until K decides to talk about E. How that girl had ""terrible manners"" and didn't know ""how to treat their customers"". And that he should fire her.

From the way K told the story, it didn't seem like M really wanted to do it. But there went M, calling E over for a private meeting. The two come out of the room, E crying and gathering her things.

K then had the AUDACITY to approach E and say: ""Don't be sad, this was good for you. Now you know how to treat customers better.

Then K finished the story by going on about how we should ""never question a customer and just give them what they ask."" I was pretty mad, and so were a few others in the room. No one laughed at any joking remarks she made after.

Thank god she only ""taught"" us for a couple days."

My sister's biology teacher can't seem to understand that my sister FRACTURED HER WRISTS,"Not trying to be whiny, but this literally boils me inside and really drives me half-crazy with protective sister rage.

Backstory: Last summer (as in the summer pre-pandemic, because that was the last TRUE summer) my sister went canoeing at a camp. She came back with very sore wrists that the doctor wrote off. Then wrote off the ongoing and worsening pain. Over a year later, my Mom finally takes my sister to the hospital despite you-know-what going around and we found out that my sister had fractured BOTH her wrists and that the broken pieces were dying from lack of blood flow (the story with our doctor belongs in an entirely different subreddit). So, her wrists are now in braces and she's scheduled for surgery at some point in the future.

So anyways, my sister has to do online classes in the meanwhile. But it's not easy, as typing is a pain for her and the pain is so bad that she sleeps a lot (the body's instinctive reaction to try and heal), so she's struggling with school. My Mom was able to get her set up with an IEP (Individualized Education Plan) or something like that so that she could get extensions on work and more time on tests. Her teachers all understood... except for her biology teacher.

I'll call her Ms. B.

Ms. B couldn't understand why my sister couldn't get work in on time, why she'd fall asleep in class (my sister just started recording the classes so that she could watch them later when she was awake), and why she'd take so long to submit assignments.

My mother, using email, tried to *politely* explain to Ms. B the situation (to deaf ears), and worse my sister even did an *assignment* about her situation... and Ms. B *still* didn't seem to understand.

I had to be told multiple times *NOT* to intervene, even though I wanted to give Ms. B a piece of my mind.

Not even this morning, when my sister ended up crying in pain during an online class because one of our cats JUMPED UP AND GRABBED HER BRACES (yes, she was wearing BRACES and it still didn't get through) did Ms. B figure it out. My sister was in so much agony that I had to leave my online university lecture to help her. My professor understood when I had to go, and he even paused the class for me (he's my all-time favourite teacher), but Ms. B just said, ""\[sister's name\] Please tell your sister you're in-""

I just shut my sister's laptop and brought her downstairs to try and help alleviate the agony my sister was in. Our mother nearly had an aneurysm from sheer rage and finally sent a ranting email to the principal, Ms. B, AND the SERT department, with the student counsellor CC'd on.

I will be so, so happy when my sister no longer has to deal will Ms. B."
Idk,"Yo reddit, my first post I tried ma best

So from 2018 to 2019 I was stuck with this Dogshit excuse of a teacher. He would cuss randomly during class, he would unnecessarily explain the notes and would later complain about how the work was incomplete since he told us not to write while he was explaining. Well call him ET (Entitled Teacher). This man would literally bully children and laugh about it with the other teachers. i was his main target for bullying since i had a bad handwriting and i still do.

&#x200B;

alright so it was exam day and in our school we get a random teacher from a random class to supervise us during the exam. ET went to mark our notes and when me and my friends walked past him he yelled "" YOU CHILDREN AND ALL YOUR POOR PARENTS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES"" because I had gotten a cheap 1000 shilling notebook to write in and I told my parents and they talked to the teacher and he told them that i had lied to them and that i had been showing off all my money at school ALL F\*CKING LIES and lmao i was in the 3rd grade now in 2021 im in the 6th grade and happy because i got rid of that bi\*ch in the 5th grade."
Teacher refused to honor the grading system,"Our music teacher wanted us to compose a music piece in groups and told that the group could influence the grading of the members, so if someone did not do the work, they would get a lower mark.

Difficulty already started in splitting up into groups. There was a boy group and a girl group who spontaneously formed and then there was the rest of us. The teacher asked if we would mind forming a group as well, to which I said I would mind (because there were some not so great guys in the mix).

Next thing I know everyone including the teacher was telling me I should really just agree and I was the only one who minded and so on. I was really wondering why the teacher asked in the first place if he did not want to hear the answer, but fine.

I don't know anything about music, but I still tried to help as best I could. One of the guys did not. Every time we came together as a group he was clowning around and distracting everybody so much that we complained to the teacher a couple of times.

If the guy had just stuck to themselve and not participated it was one thing, but he was actively hindering us. So with our deadline coming up, the group collectively decided to tell the teacher to mark this boy lower then the rest.

After the performances of each group, we had to give each other feedback and then we were graded. So the teacher said that we had asked to mark this one boy lower, at which point the all boys group started saying that that was unfair and he didn't deserve it and so on.

Now they were not present at any of our meet ups, so they had no idea what ""working"" with him was like. But for some reason the teacher decided to listen to them and give the boy the same mark as the rest of our group.

When I reminded him that he told us we could influence the marks as a group, he said that if he gave a lower mark... the boy would not learn anything from it...

I still wonder how he thought the boy would learn anything from getting the same mark as the rest, accept for that having your friends whine on your behalf will mean you won't have to face consequences for your actions."
Our class clown was our teacher,"When I was in elementary school, there was a teacher who was always making the stupidest jokes,  thinking he was so funny.

One time we were running around the playground and I bumped into the trash can quit hard. It hurt and I was crying, so my friends brought me to the teacher to tell him that I ran into the trash can.

And his response was... ""Did you apologize to the trash can?""

I got really mad at that, but timid little girl that I was, I didn't say anything, just looked at him angrily.

He then sent me inside for the rest of the break as punishment for being disrespectful...

Dude, you should not be a teacher to little kids!"
8th Grade Spanish Teacher. Why she was even a teacher in our grade? Idk. But here goes.,"In middle school, I went to a small private school. All in all, we had pretty good teachers. Except our spanish teachers. Not to say they weren't qualified, just not to teach middle schoolers. Our teacher in 6th and 7th grade was OK, but we basically learned the same things two years in a row. To say our 8th grade teacher was a step back would be an understatement. To be fair, this was her first year teaching middle schoolers, but she was brutally unprepared. She had been teaching elementary spanish before us, so her teaching methods didn't adapt well. Combine that with a class of all boys (Pretty bad decision if you ask me), and you had a recipe for disaster. For starters, she was basically teaching us sign language along with spanish, and that went as well as you would think. At one point, she moved the only four people she thought had ""mastered"" spanish over to french, which she was teaching at the same time she was teaching us. One of them could barely speak spanish by the way. The homework was literally reading a picture book online, and the questions we had to answer for it were literally like ""What is dog in spanish?"". It was nonsensical. She was very indecisive, changing her mind on a dime and immediately tried to enforce it. Once, she changed the due date of a project from two weeks out to, and I'm not joking, THE NEXT DAY. This was a project where we had to make a 30 minute video about us ordering, in spanish, at a mexican restaurant. And we had to record it at an actual mexican restaurant. There were a lot of elements to the project, and she assigned it the day before this happened.  Then, 5 minutes later, she announced that this project was now 100% OF OUR GRADE. By the way, nobody ended up doing the project at all, and she didn't even do a midterm or final, which was mandatory to pass any class at our school. She basically graded based on how she felt that day, and one time, she changed an entire kid's grades to all 0's because she was in a bad mood that day. Even though I ended the year with a 100, I took a big step back in spanish, and so did everyone else. I'm not really bitter about it, but I came across this sub and decided to post. Sorry for formatting. I will answer any questions in the comments and make edits if any comments spark any stories. Happy reading!"
No homework my ass,
My Spanish teacher thinks she is perfect,"So I have a mandatory Spanish class and we are split into 4 classes. Class A level 1 and 2, and class B 1 and 2. I am currently in class B level 2, and my teacher treats us like second-class citizens whenever she messes up. Multiple times there have been situations where there are unclear or vague directions, we, as in our group, try to tell our teacher but she is giving a mini-lesson to level 1, and eventually we cooperatively decide on an interpretation in order to not get in trouble for not doing it. She shows up, says we did it wrong, says that class A didn't get it wrong, and says that we should call her next time. Another time, there was an assignment that we should have done on a program called FlipGrid. The link to the assignment wasn't working, so nobody submitted it. About 3/4 of the class emailed her overnight, and not only did she not do anything, she then later said in class that the link works for the other class and that the people who didn't email her, which included me because I got to the assignment late, should have submitted it because the people who emailed her apparently all had simultaneous internet problems."
Advice,"I’m in my last year of middle school (Grade 8) and I’m having a really bad feeling about my English teacher. Every time I sign onto his online class, my anxiety and dread rise. Way too much for comfort. Any major warning signs I should look for? Thank you"
My teacher was too afraid of a Karen confrontation so I spent the day at school with a broken arm instead,"I just found this sub and wanted to share my bad teacher story. It was sometime ago, I'm middle aged now but this has always stuck with me.

I was in primary school in Australia (I think in American this is your elementary school equivalent?) and for those kids who arrived early we were allowed to play before the bell. I don't know the reason but one of the older boys thought it would be hilarious to rash tackle girls, I was one of the unlucky ones who got tackled but unlike some others this was done on asphalt. I scuffed my knees and palms to the point of bleeding, my uniform was dirty and torn and my left arm was on fire, I bawled, it's the only thing I really remember doing, no idea how long it took an adult to approach me but I sat on the dirty ground crying.

Eventually a teacher who wasn't mine helped me up and took me to the nurse, school was about to start so everyone was there. Then my teacher came in and asked what happened, I told her and I remember the nurse saying someone should call my mum but my teacher refused because if she called my mum she would have to call the boy's (the one who was tackling kids) mother and it was too early in the morning to deal with that woman. My teacher kept stressing that this woman always yells and asks to speak to the principal and it's his day off today and she knows the vice principal doesn't want to face a screaming woman so early in the morning either. Anyway she was so stressed about facing this other parent that she decided getting me to stop crying would be the better option. So she tried to get me to stop crying, I was in pain and she got mad at me and said I was ""putting it on a bit"" held my wrist and wobbled my arm and said ""see it's not hurting you more, if it was hurting more there would be something wrong"". She then told the nurse to stop the bleeding and I was ordered to go back to class.

Long ass day, my arm felt foreign like it was solid wood, constant pain, it swelled a fair bit, I had a ring that I couldn't get off and my finger was purple. When it was end of school time and my grandpa who always waited for me to walk me home safely took one look at me and we went straight to hospital (mum was called and met us there) and I had a broken arm.

I know mum and grandpa went to the school the next day, never knew what happened, the teacher was still my teacher and I had this big pink cast that my friends signed and drew on which was cool but I rather have not had this teacher wobble my broken arm and forced me to stay at school all day.

I still don't get her logic because it's like my mum was going to find out and call the school so why prolong that? Anyway that's my bad teacher story and F U to that teacher for putting me through that."
My failure of a school.,"For some context, I go to a charter school that does K-12. I am also one of the smartest people in my grade, so,lots of things happen.
All my teachers seem to have a high standard of what we sould do. If you finish your work early you are expected to sit quietly and do nothing. Because I always finish early, I bring a book and read. Multiple times I get told to stop reading and do my work, and when I show them I finished, I always get told, ""take your time next time.""
I understand making sure that everyone knows what their doing, but they give us work that I've done in 7th  grade. Then they get mad at me for doing something after I finish."
Teacher taking points off for no good reason,"I’m kinda just writing this to vent, also I’m on mobile so sorry for bad formatting.
So my teacher just gave me a zero on the assignment because I “rushed through it”, even though she gave us 10 minutes to do the whole thing and then next class she goes “wHoOpS i MaDe A mIsTaKe YoU dIdNt HaVe To dO iT iN tEn MiNuTeS”. God, I hate this teacher."
My teacher is judgemental,"So my math teacher is judgemental and overreactive. Before online learning she would go on yelling rampages over little things , especialy us going to the blackboard . When we asked about something she thought was stupid , like we just wanted to make sure she wouldn't yell at us for doing the wrong exercise , she would yell , or when no one wanted to go to the board od something she would start Yelling out stuff like the board is explosive , or that she would set up a bomb which would Explode with chalk and stuff . And in one year one of my classmates had a fairly good grade i'm his previous school and then she started reffering to him ""Math master"" with a sarcastic tone , when we had an exercise , she would go ""how about our math master Cuba(his name) will do this exercise for us"" which i think is very mean. And today in online class she asked everyone if they copied everything from the board , we said yes , and she started going on about us lying and if we had to turn on our webcams we wouldn't have had anything and where does that all come from? The class earlier that didn't copy down. I actualy copied everything and it was really offensive , she makes a stereotype of the whole cloass from one person , or even a diffrent class"
I skipped class and he didn't care.,"I had this really strict teacher i was in 6th grade,  he would give us tests almost every day and mark them all as major assignments (sometimes he would test us on things he never taught us). I always thought he disliked me since i was probably the one stuggling the most in his class. Once i got a 35 on his test and all he did was give me a disgust look and said ""i don't even know how you got a 35."" He didn't even try to help or ask if i understood the subject, like i'm sorry but aren't teachers suppose to do that? Another time, I skipped his class because I was late and i just geniuely didn't want to go to his class. And guess what he did, nothing. by the way, i never told anyone i was skipping class or even where i was going to be, so if he asked anyone in my class, nobody would know where i was, which is probably pretty alarming. He could've had made an annoucement telling me to go to class or called the last teacher i was in class with, but he didn't. To make it worst, when i got went to his class the next day, he didn't even ask me where i was."
Incompetent school run by incompetent people,"Just an FYI first, this is no where near as rough as some of the things I’ve read on this subreddit, but there are so many things about my secondary school that bothered me- to be fair, most of my teachers were caring and engaged but the management at the school was just awful and I feel so sorry for motivated and inspiring teachers who are inhibited and controlled by an overly formal schooling system that aims to please OFSTED and doesn’t care at all about the students well being and skill development. 

ANYWAY that being said, the head teachers and head of schools (management) of my school decided that all the student bathrooms should be locked because students were throwing wet toilet paper at the ceilings (boohoo... they’re kids get over it) so the only toilets that were open were the loos near the cafeteria. They also made SUCH STRICT rules about when you could go, you had a limited number of loo uses during classes, like if I asked my English teacher 3 times in one month they would be like ‘no you have exhausted your toilet use’. WHAT THE HECK IS THAT ABOUT?!?! Like come on for goodness sake why can’t we use the loos? As well as this, because only one set of toilets was open, we had to walk all the way to those toilets every time, and because they were so over used they were disgusting and often didn’t have toilet paper! At dinner time, the dinner lady would stand outside and let 3 people in at a time to this ONE BLOCK OF LOOS. Staggered lunches that were only half an hour where you had to use the loo because you wouldn’t be allowed to in class afterwards means everyone is stressing about going to the toilet so they don’t pee themselves, trying to fit everyone in within half an hour, queueing outside etc. My year had about 400 people, so do the math. 
Anyway, long and short of it- I swear this is why I still struggle to drink enough water, because I started drinking less to pee less which now causes migraines, headaches and general dehydration. I know it’s pretty minor but it just bugs me how can school management be this dumb?"
The Gay Marriage Debate,"I am a 24f now, but this still hurts and the memory came back to me yesterday. So, it was my sophomore year of highschool and at the time I had a girlfriend. She would walk me to class everyday and we would do a quick goodbye. Well that day when I got seated in my English class my teacher decided it was time to do a gay marriage debate. Which mind you was a topic that not even the kids were allowed to do, so sitting in the middle row in eye few of the teacher, listening to my peers say that gays were going to hell and with tears streaming down my face staring at my teacher pleading for him to stop, which he didn't and he did make eye contact with me a few times... I should have ran out of there, but I was frozen. I told my GF after words, but she was no help. She was as I later realized a manipulative emotionalyabusive homophobic a-hole. A normal person probably would have taken their crying GF to the counslers office or go with her to talk to the principal. Due to her response I never told anyone not even my parents. I finally told my dad yesterday and he was pretty pissed that it even happened, being a teacher at one point himself."
H a t e m y t e a c h e r,"Before I start I have a history of disruptive behavior in class from previous years. I misheard what my teacher was saying a couple of times and asked him to clarify so he did but then he said ""I think you're having an off day"" and ""lets just be quiet for the rest of class"" LIKE WTF MAN THATS SO RUDE I WAS HAVING A GREAT DAY BEFORE THAT I SWEAR HALF THE TEACHERS IN THIS WORLD THINK EVERYONE HAS UNDIAGONOSED MENTAL DISORDERS!!!!"
I fucking hate this teacher,"So I just did a presentation to my class and my teacher is the one switching the slides she skipped so many slides and said ""you only have two?"" it got me so mad I can't believe she's gonna be my teacher for the rest of the year. Also, I did my homework she deleted it and said I didn't do it. FUCK"
Teacher gets me in trouble after I ask a classmate for a pencil,"So a little background...

I do not do that well with math and my school has two periods for it. The first period is taught by my nice math teacher (who we’ll refer to as NT) and the second, we are watched over by the junior high basket ball coach (who we’ll refer to as Coach J). 
 Coach J imo is super unprofessional with how he handles the class. He will start up random conversation while we are working and then get on to a select few kids in his class for talking later. I am one of those kids and out of all of them, I feel I am targeted to most. On top of that he will sometimes make jokes that are definitely not okay for 12-14 year olds to hear (he supervises 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classes throughout the day). He once even made a “is it because I’m black?” joke when one student accused him of not killing a buck over the weekend.
  So onto the story...
It begins on a Thursday, just before Christmas break was about to start. I had was going through my day and made my way over to my second math class. Coach J was sitting in the back of the room with his AirPods in and told us to work on whatever work that NT had assigned us in our first math class. As I stated I am not that good in math so I had asked my friend who sits next to me if he could help me through it (it was just some homework, not a test). As he’s helping me through it, he jokingly asks if I was cheating on him as I was looking at the problem he just worked out. At that moment however, Coach J must’ve turned his volume down and overheard what he said. He gets onto me after believing I actually was cheating and sits me in the empty desk in the back of the room.
  At some point during that ordeal, NT walked in and Coach J tells her the false info (he doesn’t really like me explaining my side of situations).
  After that happened, I go about the rest of my day and low and behold, our final class’s teacher was absent and take a guess who filled in for her. Coach J proceeded to do exactly what he does during most every class he watches over and sits at the desk on his phone, AirPods in ears. We had some science work our normal teacher assigned us so I proceed to do it... only there was a problem. I forgot to bring a pencil to class.
  You may be asking “Well, why don’t you just ask Coach J if you can go to your locker to grab one.”
  Well that’s because he doesn’t really let you go and will always get on to you for not being prepared. I had a huge headache and didn’t really want to deal with that so I proceeded to ask the person in front of me for one. 
  They say no, so I ask the person to my right for one.
  They say no, so I ask the person behind me for one.
  They say no and then the person to my right rudely asked me “wHy DoN’t YoU hAvE aNy PeNcIlS?.” My head was hurting so badly at this point that I respond back to here, not even thinking about what I was saying “because I don’t have any motherfucking pencils!”
   I had instantly sealed my fate the second I said that because the girl I said that to is known to be super vocal about what goes on around her and yells at the top of her lungs “WhY yOu CuSsInG!” That was just loud enough for Coach J to hear and yells out “Who is cussing?!” The girl points at me and without letting me get a word out of my fucking mouth, he yells “GO OUT INTO THE HALLWAY RIGHT NOW!
  I head out and he walks to my ELA class. Apparently he for some reason had to tell every teacher what I had done, acting like I had said every word in the book. I’m sitting in the hallway in tears and the teachers come up to me saying that I shouldn’t be crying and saying I know what I did and crap like that. 
When Coach J comes back he hands me an essay. Now the way my schools punishment system works is you will be given an essay you have to copy twice the first time you mess up, the second time to copy it 4, and the third time you have to copy it 6, and the 4th time you mess up it’s an office referral followed by one day of ISS (in school suspension). Any failure to turn in the essay results in a suspension.
   When he hands me the essay, he went straight to 6 times and wrote that the reason I was given this was because I was “cussing up a storm in class.” On top of that it had to be done tm. As I stated before I’m not a very good student which lead to me doing 2 hours of grade recovery a day after school for at least four days.
   I was breaking down cuz I had also been assigned a shitload of homework and there was no way I was gonna be able to to all of them by the due date. I had already scheduled my session of grade recovery and would’ve had to miss it to do the essay. What ticks me of to this moment is how he wouldn’t even let me explain my side of the story and only went off of how some accused me of cussing and nothing more.
  I hop on the bus in a tear filled mess and crumple up the essay and shove it into my bag, he had kept me in the hallway till less than a minute of busses leaving.
  I go home and explain what happened to my parents who tell me to only Wright it once. My father proceeded to put his phone number on the essay and a message saying if he has any problems with me only copying it once to call him and “P.S 6x is excessive.”
  The next day I give Coach J them essay and tell him that I talked to my dad and only copied it once. He cuts me off before I can say anything else (unsurprisingly) and say that’s he will call my father. 
  Now, my father is a very intimidating man and can easily make a paper man crumble with a bit of fear. After he steps out into the hallway after 5 min on the phone with my dad, Coach J steps back into the classroom and doesn’t say a word to me. Not even a glance my way. And for the rest of the period he was basically treating me nicer that anyone else, almost like I was royalty. Idk what my father told him but whatever he said worked... for now. 
  Unfortunately, with me not showing up to my grade recovery class that I was signed for the other day, and since nobody else was attending that day, they cancelled it, the last day I could’ve made that grade up. 
Thanks for that Coach J"
The Stalking Teacher,"Hi, so this story is very old now, like 11 years the teacher is probably still alive since she was in good health, but a role on the cast todayMe - 12 year old kid on a baseball team. same grade (boy) Karl (Not His Real Name) - 11 year old friend of mine also on my baseball team, same grade (boy) Mrs. Fries (Not Her Real Name) - 34 year old to this point nice teacher that seems to have some anger problems (women)

&#x200B;

\[Backstory\] Ight, so the story starts when me and karl (both in the same grade) were at school one day. In face it was take your child to work day but since we both had parents who dealt with legal things or creating cures for viruses, bacteria, ect. (My dad retired since then but wishes he could have helped with covid-19) We had to stay in school, and to be honest, I loved baseball and sports but I was a bit of a nerd we were in the 6th grade and I already knew geometry, YIKES. But anyways we were going to gym one day, and since less than a quarter of our class was there we had what's called a ""free day"" (we could either walk 5 laps \[to get full credit\] or do any of are favorite games usually consisting of soccer, football, basketball, and capture the ball (just capture the flag with a ball and had to pull out flags to ""tag"") today we had a different one (this happened like 3 times a year). We had the choice of softball, football, tennis, or basketball. While many of our school were soccer geeks and hated this we like it because we were into baseball and softball was the closest thing we got in school. We had a game later today and decided to get a little quick practice in. (We won by a lot but that's not because we were amazing or anything but just cause the lack of talent are school had in softball or any sports really.) Then our are way back in Kate, who's school just let out came over (this was not against rules) and said hi and left. Meanwhile Mrs. Fries came over and said ""hey your pretty good play softball"" we sorta just shrugged and left. We went into the locker room and since women weren't allowed in the men's locker room and vise versa, this conflict delayed for another 10ish minutes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\[Stalking\] So we walked out of the locker room and one of are teachers noticed us (Me and Karl) wearing a t-shirt of are league (no division no team name, just league. There were thousands of players in are league 6 divisions in state (4 in county) and 6 teams in each division (they were all same age range btw). So we basically went on with are day and got ready and went to the game. Nothing to special we just did are warm ups and ready to get destroyed essentially (we were about average and were playing the best team in league). When we started are game it went as thought in the first 3 innings we quickly tumbled to a 5-0 deficit with a combined 2 hits and 3 base runners (sad). When out of nowhere Mrs. Fries comes (I guess she looked up are site, looked at games in the county today \[There were 7\] and saw if we were in any of them) but immediately we knew, our parents thinking we had invited her to are game made sure we greeted her and made her feel homey I guess. We were talking a lot in the dugout and for a pretty lame game to be honest (well lot of sitting time, I love the game in general) it was a lot to handle. So we tried to ignore her for the most part, and played are game. For some reason the second she showed up are team made a comeback, 5-0 to 5-2 in one inning and the game finished with us winning 6-7. She knew the score when she arrived, we had a small not jumbotron, but scoreboard that was with a screen (it was a rich county and this was back in the first decade of the 2000's keep in mind) so when we posted a comeback she was more than ready to get on us. 'WOW, no wonder you guys ace the class you are amazing (we really aren't) you just needed me here to cheer you own"" and I quote, that b\*tch just said we needed her to cheer her on or else we would have lost the game?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\[Next Day\] We (Me and Karl) got to school knowing today was gonna be a doozy and it was, this a long story but to wrap up the day in short, during our lunch we had a special guest. Guess who it was, Mrs. Fries. She just happened to have some special videotape taken from yesterday in 480p btw. Guess what it was about yep, are baseball game. After that she bragged on and on about how she saved the day. We later told administration that this was stalking, and that we never told her any of this. She served a 1 year suspension but quickly came back to the seen and ended up becoming the principal for that school are last year, and to be honest I was very pissed.

&#x200B;

Anyways hoped you enjoyed the story I'm thinking about starting a YouTube with stories like these because while I'm only 23 I have had a interesting life to say the least, tell me if I should or na, and if you like my story! :)"
My 7th grade teacher doesnt disapoint,So this is my 2nd post here and its about my 7th english teacher.We just had an online lesson and she expected everyone to have their homework done for the weekend and have their new words learned ist the first day of the school week the homework is shown on the first day of the week u see what am goin on there was no time what so ever for us to do our homework
My Entitled French Teacher," Here goes nothing! A bit of background: I live in England and go to a grammar school (no flex just stating what school I go to), and in Year 8. Personally Year 8 has been an amazing year because we were in school mainly and I am doing great! But there always has to be a catch! And that catch is my French teacher! I will call her BT in this story. Now on the story:

So on my second day in Year 8 I had French. Just a side note I strongly dislike  Art (but like animation and digital art idk why), Music, DT and French. But all those teachers actually teach great and care for the students. Even my last year French teacher. But this year’s French teacher is just an awful teacher. So on our second day we were set homework! Now red flag right away! I don’t mind honestly but it is a bit annoying. But her homework instructions were not clear. She said she will put an assignment (work is on MS Teams) but none of us got a notification! But that was when I found out it was on posts. She did not even mention the class! I was lucky that I found out and it was due on the next day! Most of the class were complaining and she did not even care! She was just angry and annoyed!

BT: I set you work and you did not complete it
Class: But you told us it would be on assignments 
BT: It is!
Class: But we could not find it and it was on posts
BT: Then why didn’t you complete the work I set
Class: Because we have not gotten a notification and only checked this morning
BT: Okay well do it by midnight! 
Also BT: You have Quizlet work due next week as well
We did not bother to argue but on the inside I was boiling with anger! Like you already set us work why set us more!
Another incident in class, we have these tests called IPMs, they are basically assessments to see how we were doing. Usually we have to be given a weeks notice for an upcoming ipm. But of course our BT could not care at all and just told us our IPM was on the next day! Luckily the IPM was easy but then again that just makes the thing we learnt pointless!  Finally, every lesson is a rush and when we put our hand up to ask questions she would just say no or I don’t care. So we can’t even learn. I may have said this before but it is because of here I am choosing a dead language (Latin but I like it) over French!"
My algebra teacher sucks,"Earlier this year my great uncle (who was a WWll veteran) died in late 2020 at the age of 95. And everyone in my family was mourning, and then came time for the funeral. I went to school the day before the funeral, and I asked all of my teachers if I could have the work for the next day early so I could do it on time. And when I asked my first period algebra teacher, she not only said no but made me hate her with ONE comment. I kid you not, she said take your work with you and do it at the funeral. And I have to sit in her class every morning, and it is the only thing that I think of in that room. I envy her."
Back at it again with another teacher getting arrested,Another teacher I had from last year got arrested and it was because he sent inappropriate messages to a student AND many of his old students and people he coached have come out saying how he’s groomed them. The fact none of us thought he was a bad person is sad.
bad teacher,"what should i say to my teacher that i think is bullying me? pulling my friends aside and telling them im a bad influence, dress coding me and telling other classes and teachers lies about it, talking shit about me in google meets, ect. i wanna yell at him for singling me out but i dont know what to say"
My 7th grade teacher,So am 13 and i just had an online lesson where in the middle of it prob my internet crashed and when i joined and asked my teacher if she sees me (she didnt before) she told me its my problem and that its not all about me
"My english teacher, btw.","&#x200B;

Two for one,"As the title suggests, got a twofer here. One was my IT teacher. Now, we had a project going (can't remember exactly what it was, I'm in my late 20s) throughout the entirety of which I was periodically showing my progress as he requested of us all. He knew how much effort I had been putting into it, how it was turning out etc. Then, a day before we were supposed to hand them in, I did a stupid and forgot to take my USB with my entire project on it out of my pocket and it went through the wash, becoming unusable in the process. So the next day I explained to him what happened and begged him for an extension so I could redo it. His response was that he doesn't give extensions and that I was lying and didn't do any of it. After having the seen the proof himself. Complete jerk. Then there was my Maths teacher at the school before that. Always nasty to his students, always seemed to be in a bad mood. During lunch on the last day of school for that year, myself and a few friends were on the library computers and one of them was playing Flash games off his USB stick. All his own legal stuff. Maths teacher walks in, sees him doing that, and decides it's illegal then proceeds to delete EVERYTHING off my friend's USB including school work. Needless to say, I was pissed and started yelling at him, he started yelling at me, one thing led to another and I wound up punching him in the face. Not my proudest moment."
Just a sh*tty person.,My music teacher from kindergarten to first grade made us hold it until we were literally about to 'make a puddle on the floor' as he put it just so he could teach as quickly as possible. When I said 'ack' when talking about the german language in like fourth grade he spent five minutes berating me about 'making fun of the German language'. He also made me cry in the first grade for waving too much before a play. Literally pointed that out in front of the entire first grade that I should not have waved that much and basically called me an embarrassment. He also has a youtube channel he promotes EVERY SECOND HE CAN DURING HIS CLASS.
Calling the police on students,"An old story I really need to get off my back, byr Principal in my old school was really incompetent at her job. 

Whenever students had disputes, and when Parents wanted to complain about some geniunely distressing things about the school life, such as students being bullied or students fighting, she would simply say ""The school cannot help in this, I suggest you file a police report against the students involved so that they can settle it for you"".

If the students were say, 18 and above, such as college or uni students; I would understand the reasoning to a degree.

HOWEVER, this Principal in question was the Principal of a Primary School, where the students are 7-13 year olds. (So I estimate, to be about 1st to 11 graders in the US system??)

She was telling parents. To report kids barely 10 years old. To the police. Which is absolutely insane and I don't understand how no parents pointed out how ridiculous this was.

Hell, this is an old story I forgot myself, but according to my mom, I was being bullied when I was about 9 years old and nearly got injured because the bullies threw stuff at me. My mom went to complain, but was immediately dismissed by the Principal who told her to make a police report.

And according to my mom, there had been one mother who decided to make the police report like the principal said; but as a result, she and her child was ostrasized by the local community after that incident. It was really fucked.

I only heard about this principal and what she had done recently when the topic was brought up with my mom. 

I'm still trying to comprehend how ridiculous this principal was, and I have sworn that if I ever encounter a teacher like this again who cannot at least make an effort to meet the basic requirements of protecting their students, it's going to be them I'm reporting to the police. Not the students."
Teacher tried to steal from my friend for using an ADHD toy.,"My friend has ADHD, so naturally he is always messing with something during class. A completely harmless act that affects nobody. One day, he took a small, bendy piece of plastic from his box and started screwing around with it. During this time, we were in French, the normal teacher wasn’t there, so there was a substitute (who was also a full time math consultant and tutor, not just a sub) who knew literally nothing in French (how smart!). When he took the plastic thing out of his box, the teacher got mad for essentially no reason. She took the box and said she would give it back after class, completely normal. Then when he went to get it, she said that she said after school, she did not. So we go through the whole day, nobody does anything wrong at this time, so my friend goes back to get his box with his school supplies and other things. When he gets there, I was waiting for the bus, and thought it was strange he hadn’t come back yet. He came out with the box, and he said he had to take it off her desk himself because she refused to give it back, despite saying that she would. His parents got mad and called the school, surprise surprise, nothing happened. Wanna make sure you guys think that’s kinda dumb too, because you can’t just take and keep a student’s property."
"""It's to complicated no one will play it"" -My coding teacher"," 

Bit of info This was my first year of high school and I had him for a coding class. And he would leave class randomly sometimes not even showing up and making us go look for him.

Ok so I don't know if this belongs here but I had a teacher looks like their around forty and for this story I'll call him Mr coal. so we had to make a game on the app lab section on [code.org](https://code.org/) (really simple stuff.) So I made the first couple of screens and asked him to test it so far, he ignored me so I went back to working on it. After a couple of days he finally played it but on the start screen he said "" It's to complicated people will get bored and stop playing. "" (the screen had 6-10 buttons the start button was in the bottom right with no witting on it practically hiding it.)

He made me add writing to the hidden button and told me to remove the other ones ( I'm a petty person so I didn't remove them.) Now I love coding so I was working on it at home and during class-time and for feed back I asked my peers because that's something Mr coal would never give me besides the one I stated earlier Now by this point I will mention that I got bored and added pixel art I made in my free time (this will come back later.)

now I'm going to skip over a couple of weeks to when it was due Now I had 400+ lines of code that around doubled the amount of all the others I added a lot more pixel art and ""changed"" the start screen, Now its time for him to play text my game he loads it up and when he gets to the start screen he saw that I made a pixel version of him quoting his feedback and that start screen looked normal with one button but when he pressed it another one appeared then he pressed that one and another one appeared etc. (his face was priceless). then when he got to the actual game he only got like 8 screens in then left not even getting half way to ONE SINGLE ENDING! ( one of my friends did like 38 lines of code and Mr coal helped her and gave here a A, while I got a C and he told me to follow his advise and that my game's look was bland even though I was the ONLY one that added animations and drawings in general. )

Thank you for reading my rant, I am going to do coding for year 9,10,11 and twelve because I like doing it, He can't stop me from doing what I like. (I can not do year 8 because its not a option that year.) also sorry for the bad grammar.

Edit: we had a meeting with Mr coal And he lied and said he gave me a lot of advice."
Ight so y’all wanna hear what my math teacher does,My class isn’t the best we’re not the smartest of the bunch but he’ll talk to his other classes about how we’re not smart and how we don’t pay attention and we do pay attention but he just goes through a full lesson within like 5 minutes and vaguely answer questions but yeah he’ll tell other classes we’re not smart and shit like that he’s not a very good teacher
my 4th grade teacher,"so back when i was the cutest mf in 4th grade we had this bitch ass teacher who was annoying as hell. Now she had a favorite ofc, and that favorite was my best friend. So yk i had nothing against my bestfriend but damn i had to much against that fat ass mf teacher. (she also gave me horrible grades for no reason, i got all the right fucking answers) so me and my friends were fed up with this mf, so we decided to prank her ass.   
There was this one special day we had where we could put a bunch of shaving cream on our desks at the end of the year. (and like idk why tf we was able to do that shit lmfao) So me and my friends had this plan, my teacher would leave the room and we would shaving cream her mf ass. So we did-  
We put shaving cream on her chair and all over her fucking papers cause we are the mf. The funny part is that everyone saw us do it, but they didnt rat us out. (they was chill kids ngl) So thats how we fucked with our annoying ass mother fucking teacher in 4th grade.  
(also we never got in trouble)"
My Science Teacher,"I have A’s on all my assignments in her class, besides Notebook checks. The reason I don’t have these turned in is because they’re not science related and only has science related jokes in them... I also have an F in her class. Who’s in the wrong? Me or the teacher?"
My History Teacher,"So, The first lesson we ever had with him, he had a really loud bell with him, and if the class is loud, he would ring with the words: ""In school I ring, and at home it'll be your ears."" Also, a few days ago someone in the class really obviously annoyed everyone by talking to the people that sit next to him, and he just let the whole class copy a page from the textbook in perfect handwriting for the whole lesson, and if someone wanted to say anything against that, he just wouldn't let them speak at
all and pick the next person to speak.


I really hope to hear your opinions on this.

Sorry if my english isn't that good, it's my second language."
The teacher who ruined Spanish,"When I was in Middle School, Spanish was one of my favorite subjects. All the Spanish teachers were amazing, and were able to engage the class and get everyone to memorize all of the important content. When the time came to go to high school, I decided to continue doing Spanish. The Spanish teacher in my freshmen year, who we will call Dr. S, had a PhD in Spanish, and was in her 60s. The first day of school, I was excited because I figured, wow, a Spanish teacher with a PhD! She must be an amazing teacher! I couldn't have been any more wrong. This woman had been teaching at my school for 15 years, and somehow got away with not teaching the class anything for the entire time. She did not teach us, but instead told us to open up the textbook, read a lesson, which is almost entirely in Spanish with no translation, fill out a notes guide made by the people who made the textbook, and take a review quiz after the lesson that was once again, made by the people who made the textbook. The only interactions she had with the class was when she told us what lesson to read, and on some rare occasions, she would actually give us a vague explanation of one or two pages in the textbook. You had assigned seats, and were not allowed to talk to other people for help. Once every chapter, you had a writing assignment, that was created by the people who wrote the textbook. It was really the most generic and bland class you could ever get. Whenever you raised your hand to ask her to help you, she would tell you to go back and look through the textbook again. Everyone in my class consistently got a C or lower on all of the tests, even the smart kids. She didn't even look at the assignments she was giving us, on one occasion right before taking the test, one of my classmates asked how many questions were on the test. Dr. S said she didn't know, somewhere between 20 and 50. THIS WOMAN GAVE YOU TESTS THAT SHE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT. This full time teacher who has been teaching for decades performs the same amount of work that a substitute teacher does. Sometimes, she didn't even call on you when you had your hand raised. I remember one time she was up walking around the classroom making sure everyone was doing what they were supposed to do. I had a question, so I raised my hand. I had my hand raised for over 5 minutes while nobody else had any questions, and she never called on me, leaving me to flounder in a sea of Spanish words I couldn't understand. There is no way in hell she didn't see me, because she looked right at me multiple times. I didn't experience one fleeting moment of joy or positive emotions during that class, only misery, anger, confusion, and boredom. My enjoyment of Spanish was ruined and she remains the only teacher I have ever truly disliked."
Bad 8th grade teacher,"She was good at teaching its just some things she did that always piss me off, when she gave out a test she always said the grades aloud, she always monitored us with that goguardian thing even when at home, i like to music and work and this bugged me."
One of our teachers was transphobic,"She literally took over one entire class to rant about how she's afraid that her daughter will have to room with a transgender person in some or the college, and how there is a conspiracy where seats are reserved for transgender people, depriving ""normal"" people or whatever. 

She was our class teacher, and we have not one, but two gay students in our class."
I think Ms. Umbridge works at my school.,"I once had this awful teacher that we'll call ""Ms. Umbridge"" (yes, she was that bad). She's that type of person who is always wearing either pink or leopard fur (or both) with WAY to much glitter. She walked really fast and always had on high heels so from every classroom if she was walking down the hall, you'd know ( \*clink, clonk, clink, clonk...\* ). She was all smiles until you do one thing she didn't like and you'd be in BIG trouble. And you know what her favorite thing to do is? Make rules! I kid you not, she would print out every new rule she made and hang them on the walls in the hallway (this is why we gave her the nickname Ms. Umbridge). Well in my third year of going to this school she was promoted the vice principal. \*Yay!\* Well she made the stupidest rules (with the help of the principal, who was almost as bad). We could only go up one stair case and down the other, unless we're one the second or first floor, then it switches. First-sixth graders had to use the second floor bathroom, seventh-twelfth had to use the third floor, and pre-k shared the first floor bathroom with THE STAFF. Oh, and her latest and greatest creation? No gmail profile pictures because ""some students find them offensive"". I walked straight up to her and said ""If anyone finds the picture of my dog that I've had up for years offensive then let me know."" Detention. I little while later (after a bunch of the best teachers mysteriously started disappearing), we had to combine some of the classes (there were less that 10 kids per grade). My grade (8th) was combined with the 9th and 10th for about half our classes. The only problem was that some of us had no idea what was going on in the classes and Ms. Umbridge couldn't bother herself to catch us up. Everyone else was to scared to speak up so we just started failing quiz after quiz until the class average was a D. I finally got tired of this bs and spoke up. I wasted half the class arguing with her. She finally stood up and left the room. All my classmates said that they'd back me up if I got in trouble (even the 9th and 10th grades, we all became pretty close \[uniting against a common enemy, perhapes?\]) Ms. Umbridge came back, pulled me from to room and took me to the principal's office. I'm not going back there next year."
One of my 4th grade teachers,"I did not have this teacher, but all the 4th grade teachers would collab for certain subjects like music or PE.  

We had this one teacher who I will all Mr. N.  Mr. N was known to be mean and yell alot.  One day all the fourth grade classes were together in the cafeteria for a music class.  There was one boy in our class who would make inappropriate comments to girls that can make us feel uncomfortable.  If he were older, it can count as sexual harassment, so you can imagine most people didn't feel comfortable sitting next to him.  So I noticed my best friend was in the front of the line and so I decided to go to the front of the line next to her.  I didn't realize the reason why the line wasn't moving was because everyone in the line (all girls) were uncomfortable.  So I didn't move either until another girl (We'll call her A) walked on front of me and sat next to the boy.  Me and the rest of the girls moved too.  At this point, Mr. N told A to move and angrily said to me in front of all the teachers and 4th graders YOU DO NOT LET SOMEONE ELSE SIT NEXT TO A BOY!  I want to emphasize I did not make this girl sit next to the boy, she did that on her own.  Then he made me sit closer and closer to the point me and the boy's bodies were touching.  I started crying and the boy just thought it was funny.  The other teachers did nothing.  This was all the way back in the 90s.  I do wonder if it is ok to do today, but I sure hope it isn't legal because I feel we should all have the rights to our own bodies including children.  They should be allowed to decide if they want to hug or kiss someone or in my case sit next to someone to the point our bodies were physically touching.  I am a teacher today myself, and I'm pretty sure if I pulled a stunt like that to my kids, the parent complaints would be through the roof.  

By the way, by the time my sister got to 4th grade, that entire fourth grade staff got replaced (gee I wonder why).  She said her teachers were friendlier."
My 4th grade teacher,"I have already finished high school and I can say I've had good teachers through out my school years, except for one. No teacher I've had compares to my 4th grade teacher (Mrs. V). Although she wasn't exceptionally bad, there were some things she did that were questionable.

A bit of back story, my mom got cancer around the time I was in 3rd grade. She battled it up until a little after I started 4th grade. So me, being 9 and all, took it hard. I got really depressed and lost all motivation for homework. I wasn't turning anything in or even making the attempt to do the daily reading we needed to do. It got to the point that I had to stay in for recess to do it.

Then one day, Mrs. V kind of snapped and told me to stay for recess again. This time, she said she was taking me to the office and she told me ""You're going to hold my hand since you want to act like a baby and not do your work."" So I had to hold her hand all the way to and from the office to get a referral. 

In this class, we had our own collection of books and we were allowed to take them home. At a certain point of the end of the day, our tables would be called up one by one to chose up to 2 books to take home and read. When my table went up Mrs. V called out ""I don't lend out books to kids who don't do their homework."" So I had to awkwardly turn around and walk back to my desk while everyone stared at me.

What did it for me though was this specific incident. We were preparing for our state exams at the end of the school year by switching teachers. One of the tests was literally the next day. Mrs. V taught us math while the teacher next door (Mrs.P) taught us reading and writing. We spent a few weeks switching class rooms and would spend the rest of the day with the other teacher. Well I was feeling really sad about my mom one day and really wanted to go see the councilor. ( She allowed me to come in whenever she was in her office to do whatever I wanted if I didn't want to be in class). 

So I told Mrs. P that I really missed my mom and she asked if I wanted to go to the councilor, despite us having a quiz. See, I had actually sat there for 10 minutes staring at the quiz because I forgot my pencil and I was already feeling bad all day. So when she checked my test, she didn't let me back into the classroom. I came back to the class quickly because my councilor wasn't in her office. Mrs. P called Mrs. V and explained what happened and my teacher blew up in the hallway.

She straight up said ""I don't care that your mom died, you have STAAR tomorrow!"" She just grilled me about not doing my homework all year and that I needed to step up my game and all that. I was just standing in the hall while these 2 teachers yelled at me about trying to get out of a quiz. 

Our STAAR tests came and went and I actually got 100% on the math one. I also got commended on the reading one. 

Mrs. V ended up becoming a 5th grade teacher and I was really hoping I didn't get her again (I didn't) but I still had to sit in her class room a couple of times and you get tell there was some sort of resentment or something with the way she would give me instructions. She would always talk to me like I was in kinder and didn't understand her. 

Thankfully she ended up moving to another city at the end of my 5th grade year so there wasn't a chance my siblings could've had her as a teacher."
My 2nd grade disaster,"So Even though im in 9th grade i wanted to share how horrible my year was during second grade. I can't remeber how this all started but to say that this was a Bad teacher is an understatement. Apparently She wasnt fond of how weird or different i was to the class partly because of my personality and partly because of my ADHD (which i didn't even know i had then) and she wanted all the students to be the same no matter what, and so because i refused ""even though there was no obligation to behave the way the teacher wanted in the first place and the only rule was just to be a good kid) to be the same as everyone else, she outcasted me from the class, Ridiculed me of my differences, got almost the entire class in on the whole ""lets bully me because im different"" train, called me dumb due to me not wanting to read a book when apparently it was ""read a book time"" (even though in the school there was no such thing and apparently students aren't supposed to be obligated to read something unless if it is part of the lesson, btw as i am now i am way smarter than she ever was), She verbally abused me (she put my desk next to hers, treated me like a retard, and whenever i would space out she would yell at me "" DO YOUR WORK NOW!"" even though it wasnt really on purpose i was spacing out), she apparently gave me a time out because there was this time when i was putting a thesarus back in the shelfs, she said something along the lines of ""maybe if you would read more like the other students, you would be more smarter"" and i said ""whatev's"" due to me not knowing how to filter back then, so apparently she made the whole class repeat what i said in a almost humilitingly childish way, and then she gave me a timeout for everything (made me even skip specials, or other non core subjects, and lunch, and reccess) to just only sit with her through a 3 hour period of her just yelling and belittilng me, and when my parents had a confrence with her, my parents were concerned as they should be, but they never saw a problem, meanwhile the teacher just rolled her eyes at them, and then when she left she unkowningly started a trend of almost the entire grade bullying me until middle school.

Don't worry now because im more happier i could ever be and anyone who even tried to bully me gets shut down, it seems karma has run its course, and is probably still even running. But all in all,

TL;DR: Was basically abused by teacher, and class (implicitly influenced out of fear but then started to actually like it) for Being Different than everyone else in the class, intentionally or unintentionally."
My Crappy 5th Grade Teacher,"When I went to open house in the summer, I met who I thought would be my teacher, but she left to go to another school (I had her for 6th grade, she was a really good teacher). So for a while, my class had a substitute who we really liked. Then my real teacher came. At first, she wasn't that bad, just waaaaaay more strict rules, but that's fine. So, in 5th grade, I was bullied mercilessly, so much so that I actually started to become depressed (I'm better now for those of you wondering). My parents emailed the teacher about this, and she said (from my memory) ""He looks fine he doesn't act depressed in class"" And my parents were pissed. They kept emailing her and then finally she sent me to the counselor, I told her what was going on, and who was doing it. She said she would do something about it. Rest of the year, jacksh\*t. I found out she quit after the year I had her a year later."
Bad af,I have a crappy food teacher he gave me a dt for isolating for 2 week
My little brothers special ed teacher made me his personal prostitute for 5 months.,"I was 15 and autistic and neglected so quite vulnerable. He was friends with my neighbors and had offered to help my brother learn to read, and as his second job was a handyman fix things around our house. (Which was often  in bad shape because of neglect) he also bought us $20 worth of groceries every week so we wouldn’t go hungry. I felt obligated to him for those reasons and due to my autism I didn’t know I could tell an adult no. Eventually he’d have me meet him at a bus stop that wasn’t by my home and we’d drive to the park for s3x five days a week and he’d come over most weekends when our mom was at work. Because he convinced me this was normal and that he didn’t know what he was doing was wrong so I withheld information when the abuse first came to light and by the time I fully disclosed what happened there was insufficient evidence to convict. Fortunately I was able to check that he’s not allowed to teach in any of the counties near where he lives or where I lived but he never faced charges. He was a special education teacher and he took advantage of my special needs. So the scum of the earth. He was actually still training for becoming a full time special ed teacher as he was still technically working as a student teacher or something and he wasn’t able to finish school because of the accusations I don’t think. 

TLDR my brothers special education teacher took advantage of my autism and neglect to force me to have s3x with him 5-7 days a week for five months. He can’t teach but never faced charges."
i had a teacher who bullied me for packing up stuff i didn't need!!!,"Ok a little background info. I accidentally broke my wrist in sixth grade, i was running backwards and toppled backwards in gym, on carpet. so yeah for around half of that year i couldn't do crap with my left hand. and we had to walk across my school for our last 2 classes and i had math in the class just before. and i had a small roller bag like the ones people use in airports to pack my stuff so it took a while to pack up

so, that day i thought,""hey i could not be late to class if i pack up some stuff i don't need"" so i did. i packed up my binder and everything except the math stuff i needed. you would assume this wouldn't be a problem right? wrong, my teacher stormed over like emperor Palpetine if he had children. and basically yelled at me! the conversation basically went with us going back and forth with her yelling at me and me trying to defend myself. i don't do well with adults yelling at me and i just started crying in the middle of class. honest to god my teacher felt that it was necessary to yell at a kid with a broken wrist for packing up rather than doing her job because she basically yelled at me for like 10 minutes.

i was having an emotional breakdown and this girl in the table next to me was mouthing the words ""why are you crying?"" i mouthed back ""fuck you retard"" because i was getting screamed at inf front of the entire class, not like it was secretive at ALL. She said I was gonna leave last no matter what and i just kept sobbing. and i ended up leaving last and crying down the hallway. a teacher saw this and walked me to the counselor and i told her EVERYTHING. she said she would call my parents. nothing really happened afterwards except that i moved to the other math class that was the person who walked me to the counselors office. I'm still upset that she wasn't fired. and i learned in that same year SHE TOLD ALL HER CLASSES I FLUNKED OUT BECAUSE OF MY GRADES. i was livid and i still want to just deck her across the face whenever i see or think about it.

i hope that this was a somewhat enjoyable story for you all. Also this is my first post btw"
4th grade teacher treated me like crap,"Long story short my teacher had a thing against me when i was younger and there’s was this one day where she took my soccer ball away from me, the next day we are doing work and i’m working hard, after i get half way done, i stretch my arms then when i’m about to get back to work she says “doing that isn’t gonna get your ball back” and i said “i didn’t do anything” she called home and me and my mom went to have a parent teacher conference. btw i love you mom but for this moment you did me bogus. and Fuck you Ms.Lei"
My Sophomore Year English teacher gave me a D on a paper because she was bored.,"At the beginning of my sophomore year, we got a new, fresh out of college, English teacher who, out of the gate, did not like me. One of the first assignments was to write about our most memorable experiences. The paper had to include pictures and had to be a minimum of 2 pages with no maximum.

As I was writing and including pictures, I realized mine was getting long. As I finished, I got to 10 pages. I doubled checked with her that there was no maximum page limit. I triple checked to reassure myself and she kept saying “There is no maximum, just tell the story.” 

So I printed it off and turned it in. A few weeks later, she handed the paper back and I received a D. Now, I am not the best writer, but I didn’t do D level work. I reviewed the paper to see what was marked. There were 2 grammatical mistakes on the first page, one on the second, and the rest of the page had no markings. 

When I got home, my parents were furious and we emailed my teacher to set up a meeting to discuss the paper. Her and I met after school and she told me, verbatim: “I read the first two pages, got kinda bored, and just gave you a D because I was bored.” I stood there DUMBFOUNDED. So obviously, I told my parents, and they met with the head of the English department. She regraded and gave me a low B-, I wasn’t going to try and fight it further.

I’m still salty she didn’t get in trouble for that, but I did find out that she and my sister graduated from high school together and she didn’t like my sister. So apparently I had to suffer for it?"
My 8th grade Math teacher told me I would amount to nothing.,"In 8th grade, we did a dual English/Math project where we researched about our future career. For the math section, we had to do a projection of salary and how we would plan accordingly for our future. At the time, I wanted to be involved in the theatre world, but I wasn’t sure exactly what job yet. I had put a few different jobs in the category, which all made sense and some projections. 

When my presentation was over. We asked the class if they had any questions or comments and before I could ask my math teacher raised her hand and said “You will never amount to anything in theatre.” 

I was SHOOK. I was, what, probably like 13 or 14 at the time? I was like how can a teacher, who is supposed to SUPPORT us, say something like this to a kid? I remember just standing there frozen. I wasn’t the most popular and I was often picked on and even bullies were apologizing to me after.

Anyways, here we are so many years later. Not only have I graduated college with my degree in theatre, I just finished my MASTERS degree in theatre too. I am working as a technical director and hoping to find a professor job soon.

Part of me wants to say a big fuck you, to that teacher, but she kept that fire in me to keep moving forward to prove her wrong. And strive for success. I’ll say this, when I teach I plan to be nothing but supportive and help my students succeed instead of tearing them down."
Thought this belonged here. The kid wasn’t the stupid one.,
My worst teacher / first grade teacher,My first grade teacher was a jerk she gave us silent lunch for no reason so on the last day of school (me=me te=teacher and best=best friend ) me and best were just sitting at our desk and the teacher just yelled in a drunk voice you 2 have silent like lunch me and best were just quiet like what the frick. Later we saw the teacher drinking out of a water bottle that was completely blacked out so me and best were like oh it is just water or coffee so we served or silent lunch then the teacher’s breath smelled like alcohol so we went to recess and then left school/we ate lunch right before we left school. Then we went to school next year and we heard that the teacher got fired we were so happy .sorry the post was so long
Most passive-aggressive teacher I have ever had,"First of all, I am in 7th grade and have a problem with my English teacher and I don't know what to do. She plays lots of favorites and acts like my answers are stupid and they don't matter even if they are the right answer. For example, I did what I normally did which is sit in my seat and read the board. That particular day it said ""Sit in your assigned seats and read your book"" So I did what the board said. 

I sat down and was reading and out of the blue she says in the most condescending tone, ""Lucas, Mabey you should do the work that you missed last week instead of reading"" She said it like I was a stupid 4-year-old and like it was so obvious and like I had skipped out on school (Which I hadn't I had a serious infection and had to get an ultrasound) and the worst part is she did it to make an example out of me in front of the class. And it's not like she didn't know I was sick because my absences were marked as medical.

So I got a Chromebook and started on my work and after 15 minutes she started the lesson. I put the Chromebook away and she asked us what kind of stories Edgar Allan Poe wrote ( our assignment was on his life and we were supposed to make a claim on what kind of stories he wrote based on evidence) So I raised my hand and said ""Scary stories"" and she made me sound like an idiot by saying ""oh you wouldn't know because you weren't here last week so you must have gotten that from somewhere else"" I responded ""But you just told me to read the evidence from last week and I did"" and she just ignored me as nothing happened. 

The next day I tried to save some trouble by getting straight on the Chromebook and working on the late work from the week before when she unexpectedly said ""Umm, Lucas you should be reading your book instead. That work was due last week and you should have done it then"" The rest of the class period whatever questions I asked she would treat me like an idiot and then call on someone else to give the same answer as me or even a wrong one and praise them. 

I don't have a good ending where she gets where she deserved but I'm hoping for an answer in the comments. I'm also hoping to switch teachers next semester. I have a lot more stories about this teacher that I could write a book on and I'm just starting the 2nd quarter. I need help in the comments. 

ps. also my first post"
My grade 7 teacher,"To start i am 17m. My elementary school was and still is small so small that I was in a 5-6-7 sit class. And after grade 6 most of the teachers left. There was 1 teacher left from when i was in grade 3 (I started at that school in grade 3) and the only other teacher I knew came when I was in grade 4. My grade 7 teacher was new and was ok. He had a point system (in my class of 30 people there were 4 girls.) And almost all the boys, except the favorites got points deducted but the girls didn't either. You might be thinking ""well the boys just didn't follow the rules"" but I assure you, we followed the rules. We would get deducted for stupid things, like you drop your pencil, or you sneezed when he was talking, and the thing is, the girls did this and nothing happened, but when a boy did it, it was 1-2 points deducted. There was this boy in class that was my friend since I was in grade 3. So at the time he was in grade 6. We were working on an assignment where we argue a point with the teacher and he had said a good argument for his and i said ""that one was smooth"" and gave him a pat on the back, but the teacher saw and tried to give me trouble for ""hitting him"" but friend even said that i didn't hit him, it was just a pat on the back. But I still got detention that day. If one person took something from someone else without asking it was 10 points deducted and they were told to ask first. Well I had a rubik's cube in 7th grade and I brought it, it had taken me 3 months to figure it out (and I didn't think to just Google it) and I just solved it near the end of class. Then one of the favorites came up, took it and messed it up and the teacher said nothing. Actually all he said was ""don't bring it next time"" or something like that. And the favorite got off scot free. He pissed me off sometimes. My grade 6 teacher (who left after grade 6) was cool and let us do fun stuff, like plant a speaker in the kindergarten classroom and talk in to it and make them look for it by saying stuff like ""im by your backpacks"" for April fools and let us hide in the gym equipment room to see how long until we were noticed. But this new guy wasn't to keen on those ideas. If i could put it to an example it would be his group of favorites (all 4 girls and like 3 boys) were treated like first class citizens and the rest of us were second class citizens. I realized how poorly he was treating us a couple years ago and wondered of he still had his job there so did a quick Facebook search and saw him asking for a stroller for his kid. I decided not to do anything because thats the history but I still get irritated thinking about it"
Annoying Teacher Story," 

You know those teachers who try to be all up and fun with the students? The ones who talk with the popular girls like ""mm gurrrl"", but we all know they're being sarcastic. Yeah well, in middle school I had a teacher who was just like that. She wasn't young either, she was in her 40s probably. I was in an all girls' elective class and I was a very introverted/anti-social person. So as you can guess, I didn't talk to any of the girls in that class. But the teacher sarcastically tried to talk with the girls in my grade as they gossiped about their boy crushes and the overall drama that goes on in their friend group. I always stayed out of it, because me being the closeted gay and non drama llama that I am, I didn't want to be involved. Yeah. My teacher wasn't having it. She'd constantly try to get me into the group and have conversations with the girls, but it would always just be awkward. Now before you say, ""Oh but she was doing it out of kindness so you wouldn't feel left out!"" No. It certainly didn't feel that way at all. She seemed like she took pleasure in making me feel uncomfortable with these gossip girls. So I would smile awkwardly as I sat in between their conversations. This is not where the story ends though, oh no no no. One day my mom and I went to pick up my younger sister from day care (which was at my school) and we just so happened to run into my elective teacher. I was hoping it'd be a quick ""hello, goodbye"" situation, but it wasn't.  
Teacher: ""Hello! Is this your mom? Nice to see you, is your daughter always this quiet? She's so quiet in class, she doesn't talk very much. You need to talk more!"" And then she walked away. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said I wanted to walk into the streets without saying a word and get run over by a car, but my mom was certainly uncomfortable with the comment. We both pretended it never happened and I still hold these grudges towards her to his day. But I hope she's doing alright :).

(P.S her daughter taught my art class for half of a semester and she was HEAVENLY. I don't get the relation?)"
My highsc English teacher,"The way my school works now because of this... thing, my school has quarters instead of semesters. So this quarter I had English and she is a horrible teacher. First she's a bitch. The way she talks to you makes you feel like your inferior to her. Then because of this thing its supposed to be a ""hand-out-less"" year and all online, we just have to go to the school. Then she gives handouts. Then it's back to online. Then she gives another handout... see where I'm going? Then she makes a slot online for an assignment, then the day before its due says we have to hand in a physical copy. We use oure phones in class because that's all we have on us and for me personally its hard to print stuff from my phone and I don't know how, so I can't hand stuff in that way. I hand it in online, like she originally said to do, and it doesn't get marked because i was supposed to hand in a physical copy. Here's the best part. We read a book for novel study, she assigns reading for home, then doesn't send the books home. I get it, with this thing going on i can see why she doesn't want to send them home. If you can't send the books home don't assign reading. 

One of the issues I had in her class was it was so fast. I just transferred to this school so I came in 2 weeks later. She gave me no time to catch up. If I transfer in late to a class I want the teacher to ""help me get up but not hold my hand through everything"" meaning give me some leeway to catch up, but she expected all three assignments to be done in 2 days, ontop of the homework she usually sends, ontop of that i have to work.

Grading comes around and ""because I didnt do the assignments properly she cant mark me properly"" so she failed me. She looked me in the face and said i probably would have failed even if this thing wasn't going on and classes went in semesters like normal. 

This is a nit pick on my part, but she constantly slurps when she talks. For example ""so this is how you annotate a poem *slurp* if you want extra credit annotate 2 of the 3 poems we looked at and hand them in *slurp* make sure you hand in a physical copy"" and it just really annoyed me. I really hope she retires soon but I doubt that'll happen because she looks young.

To end this I think she might be a bit sexist because all of the (7 including me) boys in the class didn't do good in her class and all the girls, from what I can see did good. There was one girl who did less work then me and got a b (she told me afterwards)

EDIT: the title should say highschool"
the teacher tried to get my parents to get me medication,"in 3rd grade I had the worst teacher ever. (ill be calling her Mrs. B) I feel like the entire year she just had it out for me. like she used to do have these ""fun"" things where she would have like a mini breakout room with a little box, one time earlier in the day I had told Mrs. B that my math group was doing something that they weren't supposed to, and at the end of the day when were supposed to do the mini breakout room, I was told that I wasn't allowed to. This upset me so I started crying and she pulled me out to the hallway to calm me down, than she told me that our entire math group wasn't allowed to do it because of what happened earlier, when I pointed out that I was the only one from our math group not doing it she got mad at me and called the principle. see what I mean? I came home crying every single day and my parents kept emailing her over and over and over again but Mrs. B didn't do anything about it, the only time she stopped is when my parents CCed one to the principle. ok, now on to what I said in the title. anyone who misbehaved in her class at all she would send a email to their parents saying that they had ADHD and needed medication, she basically wanted mindless zombies in her class. when she sent an email to my parents saying that, they were very mad. the worst part is is that I was not a bad student, the worst thing I did was read when I wasn't supposed to. It was awful, Mrs. B was so bad that my younger brother's friend actually went to a different school because of how bad she was. me and my best friend were in the same class, (the only person that kept me sane) she suggested that he should get a exercise ball, so his parents bought one for him and the first week that he had it Mrs. B confiscated it for no reason and NEVER GAVE IT BACK! she just kept it and didn't even give it back at the end of year! I am now in high school remembering this, and I remember going back in 4th grade because I heard that she was giving out lollypops, so I went there, said hi, got a lollypop, but before I left I saw a bunch of blue plastic chips on her desk so I asked what they were, and Mrs. B said that if she puts it on someone's desk it means that they need to stop raising their hand. which basically means if she gets fed up with a student asking questions she would just make them stop. she is still the worst."
The worst teacher ever,Probably had some pretty bad teachers before but the one I had she was like a helper teachershe would always say that she loves the kid and stuff but one day one reason she started saying oh one of my friends shouldn't be in the class she tried to do everything just to separate me my friends to the point he got one of my friends to leave the school then she brings her cousin here to talk crap about all the other teachers and kids here and she's literally I'm sitting next to her watching her talk all the stuff she's talking about each one of the kids then I had to leave schools because of her because she's now this ruining the whole school day and makes it seem like she really likes me but really she didn't she just used me as something to look good really she separated almost all my friends but I only had like two friends left those are the last actual friends I had before I had to leave
My crappy Chinese teacher,"In primary school, we had this shit Chinese teacher. Everyone hated her and I’m pretty sure she hated most of us, too. My class had library just before Chinese, so we all had our books that we burrowed. So anyway, we get to Chinese, and keep in mind that I have a natural aptitude for languages but to this day I still only know how to say hello thanks to that fucking teacher. So we’re in class and I have no idea what’s happening and I get really bored. So I was just kinda staring at the cover of my book. When I look up, my Chinese teacher looks me dead in the eye, turns back to the whiteboard, writes a *paragraph* in Chinese characters, turns back to me and announces to the class “Mocha can translate this for us since she’s reading her book”. She was talking to me. Since I had no idea what any of that shit said I was just sitting there like 👁👄👁

Upon seeing that I’m clueless, she says “don’t know?? I thought so. Anyone else wanna try?”

She singled me about multiple times and she did it to a lot of other people as well. We were all relieved when she retired."
My old humanities teacher,"A couple years ago my friend and I were sitting next to each other and were telling jokes and just fooling around. So of course, our teacher comes round and blames me for being off task and “doing things on my laptop that weren’t on task”. She asked to see me after class and told me to open all the tabs on my laptop. There was a game open from a couple weeks ago that I hadn’t bothered to close down. So of course, I get blamed for that and she yelled at me to the point of tears. I apologised and said that it wouldn’t happen again multiple times but she kept going. She rhymed off every bad thing I’d done throughout the year and even brought up my bad time management, which I had very little control of. After that, I would start tearing up at random points throughout the day with no warning. She stopped being our favourite teacher very quickly..."
Teacher from hell,"It’s been 5 years since I had this teacher and I still get scared over these things:
A Chevy Tahoe parked at home
My mom or sister waiting for me at the door
Talking during school at any time
6th grade broken me down and it’s all thanks to Her and that shitty drug ridden school.
I was being bullied to the point of me crying after school before I got home. My teacher would call home and make it seem I was crying for no reason but was a distraction. She always heard them bullying me and never said a word about it. She was hearing them being awful to me and just had the gall to call my parents. I went from talking with my friends and hanging out to always doing tutoring because I was failing her class. She didn’t tutor me of course and would act like whatever question I had was such an inconvenience. I hate that she got nominated for teacher of the year"
I might have the worst teacher in my grade this year.,"So, I have an ELA/SS teacher. I thought she'll be a nice lil old lady but boy I was WRONG. This happened during zoom, I was called into her zoom meeting (class). There were other kids there so I felt calm knowing that I wasn't in trouble. But that was false hope, it looked like I didn't finish a simple test. I didn't realize I had one, since I was absent due to visiting my cousins that day (They live about 5 hours away). She was mad at everyone, especially me. She wasn't upset, she was furious. But she covered it with a big fake smile. ""Why weren't you in class yesterday? Maybe if you were present you wouldn't be here honey."" I thought I already told the school about my absence, she should have known. But she is getting upset over a test that I could have finished right now, I knew she was going to throw a tantrum. I politely told her about my visit to my cousins, yet she was still furious. ""Why didn't you go during the weekend, you had a lot of time."" Yeah, why didn't I go during the weekend? Maybe its because it was Ethiopian New Year, maybe that's why. During those few minutes all she did was complain and complain, and the test wasn't even important. That's when I started to hate her.

Then it was during the Assembly (zoom). I had my camera off due to my wifi lagging (and also because i'm self-conscious about my looks). The teacher decided to private message me about it and saying it was disrespectful though literally 75% of the students (and teachers) had their camera off. So I ignored her and went back to focus on the announcements. After the Assembly meeting ended, my Dad got an email from her saying I had my camera off, she complained throughout the whole email. My friend, who also turned her camera off, did not get an email like that. Oh boy. Now since my friend didn't get an email I think that my teacher might be racist (since i'm black and my friend is white) but i'm not sure.

The fact that she gets angry at little things like if I forgot to turn in an assignment she gets mad, when I ask a question she replies by ""Find out yourself, sweetie."" or ""I cannot help you with that."" It makes me upset to know that I might be her least favorite student. I don't like it when people dislike me, it scares me and makes me feel like i'm not good enough. I want to be good enough. But I can't because this old little lady keeps on complaining and complaining. All those complains led to my parents hating me as well (they think I don't pay attention to class or not putting any effort in my work). Now, I don't wanna go to school (physically). I just want to stay home in bed and sleep. That's all. But I can't because the teacher would notice and call me parents. I feel pressured. And i'll put the fault on her. I might have the worst teacher in my grade this year."
My friend got choke by the teacher!!,When I was in 4th grade I went to school like any other day and I had to go to RSP it's for kids who don't do their work when I got back from that program I got told that my friend got choked by the teacher cuz he had his hoodie on the teacher use one hand to try to take it off but it got stuck on my friend's neck and the teacher use both hands to take it off and the zipper was cutting and choking him the next day the principal call everyone into his office and I told him the same story.
This teacher is just bad,Ok I’m still super mad about this. I got a new Spanish teacher this year and she is TERRIBLE. I have done all the work she has assigned and I have a 19.93 in that class. LIKE IM FREAKING TERRIFIED. I don’t know what to do. I am not the only one this is happening to. THERE IS NO PASSING GRADES IN BOTH LEVELS OF THE CLASS THAT SHE TEACHES. It is an online corse using a terrible program and our facilitior hates her too. I don’t want to get in trouble at home and don’t want to get a bad grade. But Listen what I found out today. She refused to accept this kids work that was BEFORE the due date. And the facilitator is going to take it to the STATE. And the superintendent of the county wants her fired too. I’ll update if anything happens. Edit I think my facilitator gave her a big yelling at because she finally put in most of my grades. I now have a b and honestly don’t care anymore. But some kids still don’t have theirs graded and still are failing.
I hated my teacher,"  

Fifth grade teacher didn't like me and he used to humiliate me in front of the class because I couldn’t figure out long division problems. He would keep me standing, red faced, at the blackboard for twenty minutes while he made snide remarks instead of explaining how to solve it. I hated him so much I prayed for him to die, … and he did. Had a stroke and I got a better teacher. I was ten and not sorry."
Crap tutor,"Was not a teacher but close enough that I think it counts.

In second and third grade me and some of my friends would go out and play football with some other kids. This tutor gets highered and she was like a permanent recesses tutor which never happens. Anyway she she’s us playing football and says “that’s too dangerous” we were playing touch and there was like seven of us. Not crowded or dangerous. So next day we play ultimate tag, “you could poke someone’s eye out trying to tag them” . Next recess me and my friends draw. “ you need to do something active”. We have a dance coming up in pe so we practice that. “You can’t practice dancing it’s too dangerous”, soccer, “ the goalies could get hit in the head”. “ basketball, “ the ball could fall down and hit someone on the head”. Groundies,” you could walk off the playground”. There was more but I can’t remember them. Point is she absolutely hated me and my friends. Never got into a single other person, just us."
Bad Teachers Episode 2: First and Second Grade,"So, I already talked about my bad first grade PE teacher. But what if I told you it got worse. Much, much worse...

My first and second grade teachers, Mrs. H, liked to yell. A lot. Why did she yell so much? I dunno. But my elementary school liked to hire people who yelled a lot. I can imagine an interview now...

A shadowed figure enters a room as the Star Wars sith theme plays in the background.

“So... you want to be a teacher at this school?” The figure asks the woman seated across from it.

“YES! I DO!”

“And what are your qualifications?” The figure asks.

“I LIKE TO YELL AND BE MEAN TO SMALL CHILDREN!”

“Okay, you’re hired.”

The unknown figure is foreshadowing for what is to come.

Anyways, Mrs. H was also very mean. Scratch that, she was just a bitch. She very much liked to tell small children that they were useless and wouldn’t achieve anything. What a great hobby. That sure didn’t make me cry myself to sleep as a FUCKING SECOND GRADER.

Jesus, I hated this woman. She also liked to do class read-alouds, where she would read a book to us and swear a lot. If someone so much as breathes loudly, they would be sent to sit on the cold, filthy hallway floor.

The good thing was, she was so loud you could hear her through the wall.

That’s all about her! Don’t worry about this series ending soon, Elementary School alone has about 3 more parts. Bye!"
“Exercise is good for you!”,"I just recently discovered this sub, and am going to share the stories of every bad teacher I have ever had. Since I’ve had enough to fill a novel, I’ll go in chronological order. First off: Mrs. S.

She was my PE teacher in first grade. PE is supposed to make you very strong and well-rounded in all forms of exercise. Not with her. All. We. Did. Was. Mile. Runs.

All my first grade class did, for the entire period, was run a mile. If we finished before the bell... we got to run another mile! Yay!

And she provided us lovely words of encouragement that rhymed with “move your asses!” and “hurry up!” Such a kind lady.

Also, once, during the second mile run of the class, I collapsed from exhaustion because I had just recovered from being sick and was still kind of weak. She literally just laughed at me.

If someone got cold or hot, and wanted to take off/put on a sweater, she yelled at us that we didn’t have all day and to stop wasting time.

Thankfully, over the summer, she went on sabbatical to India and never returned. We all hoped she was eaten by a tiger."
school dance,This was at my school dance in 7th grade. I was making a stack of cups about 36 cups high and I was trying to stop people from knocking it over then my annoying teacher came over and knocked it over. Then I had to rebuild it then she just came back and knocked it over again I really hated her
"Teacher yelled at me for going to the toilets for ""too long""","A couple of years ago, I was in Year 3 (around 7/8 years old) and this stupid teacher loved to yell at me. One time i asked to go to the toilets and she allowed me to but when i came back she yelled at me for taking too long even though i didn't take that long and won't tell me what to do for work and told me to figure it out myself.

Another time (think this was in Year 4) she explained the task to us and said we could work in pairs or by yourself. The girl next to me immediately asked if we could work together. I said ""no thanks i want to work by myself"" as this girl literally copies EVERYTHING i write and i find that quite annoying. She even copied my art and claimed that i stole her idea even though she begged me to tell her my plan. Anyway the girl told the teacher that i won't help her and the teacher proper yelled at me in front of the whole class. I don't remember the exact details but she shouted something like ""why won't you help her?! If you need help in the future she's not going to help you"" etc. I stood there dumbfounded. I never said i won't help her, i just said i don't want to work with her. Also i don't think i'll ever need her help in the future because she's proper dumb (not trying to be mean).

Good news: she was apparently fired sometime later that year as i never saw her again."
temporary principal is discriminatory against a worker,"hi i just found out about this story from a friend of mine that happened today or yesterday any ways onto the story: 

worker: w

Principal: Dick

In these times people are needed to disinfect buildings constantly and make sure people don’t get too close. W is one of those workers and he’s a very great guy, he’s smart and an all-around great guy to have as a friend, but he does have an issue with talking. You need to pay attention to him otherwise there’s a good chance you are going to miss what he is saying, it’s not a big problem, but apparently for some it is.

Since most of W’s job includes cleaning the cafeteria, disinfecting it, and making sure students don’t get too close while they don’t have their masks on, he’s gotten close to a few kids that don’t really have a lot of friends, well Dick took note of this and decided oh yeah that can’t happen because when the year is over W is going on a mission trip that’s going to be several months (I think).

Dick: hey W can we have a chat please?

W: sure, what’s up?

Dick (reading from a letter he wrote prior to calling W in): so I noticed that you’ve been getting closer to certain students.

W: yeah what about it?

Dick: well since you’re going on that mission trip I don’t think you should have or make friends here at XX, because they’ll be sad when you leave.

W: (very sadly) okay sir…

Dick had done something awful that affected my family and many other people pervious to this so if you'd like to hear it please say so."
Help,"I am currently a college senior that is aiming to finish all my general class and any history classes that I need to complete. So then I can do student teaching in the spring (COVID or not). For does who do not know how student teaching works. You can only take that class and nothing else (unless it's an independent study). Now here is the issue at hand I am currently an upper beginning Spanish class. I knew that it would be a challenge since I am taking four history classes and one bio class. But I have been juggling all classes quite fine that was until when I did the first Spanish test. It was bad like how is one suppose to complete a 67 question exam in 1 hour. Now you would think ""Was the exam mostly multiple choice?"" and I wished that was the case. Instead, we got 10 multiple choice and 57 short responses that were broken down like this-10 questions with listening portions to answers the questions. 10 questions that had you read a paragraph and answer the questions. 10 other questions were 10 were multiple fills in the blanks (like 6 in question) and 7 were a single fill in the blank. When I questioned the teacher that the exam was impossible to complete when we had class the other students also voice the same concern. It has gotten to the point where I sent out a grade appeal to everyone (felt like starting a revolt) as she is giving 0.7 out of 10 as a grade. If it was a 7of out of 10 my grade would not be a 68. I mean I have a 3.3 GPA and on the dean's list so I bust my ass when in class/home. I am not the type of student who slacks to the point my grades drop. I talked to the dean and even she agreed that it was insane and email the chair. (Oh did I mention that the exam was an online and open book for crying out loud. Who in their right mind times an open book exam when it's online WTF!!! and the icing on the cake was that the highest grade was 72 ( I found this on the grade scale on canvas) but this snake of Prof changed it four times (we have office 365 and since it's linked to canvas were are notified of every change) to where the highest grade was a 78. I feel like I am fighting a machine and I am only armed with screenshots of proof, other student backing me up and going to the dean, and now who know what will happen. But my question to my fellow Redditors is should I bug the deans until they listen. Or wait until I get my final grade and appeal it with all the proof?"
Sub teacher smacks student with a ruler,"Ok, this happened to my friend about a year ago. So she was not paying attention to class so the sub just went up to my friend and smacked her with a ruler. She told her parents the next day and reported it to the principal. The principle asked all the kids in the class what happened and all of them said that the sub smacked her with a ruler. She got fired the next day and probably went to jail for child abuse."
My teacher removed me from the meeting :|,"Not a cool story but I want to tell it  
so I commented something before class started (something funny to me and my friend)  
and the teacher saw the comment and removed me   


CLASS NEVER STARTED IT WAS JUST ME AND MY FRIEND AND SHE SAID I WAS DISTRACTING THE CLASS

Teacher who teaches students to teach gets taught a lesson,"I got a story that happened in my last year of high school in 2005 that featured a double standard teacher, a pretty jock that made all the girls drool, a confused vice principal and me, the nerd that everybody could take a shot at and get away with it.

Characters: Me (obviously) Jock (J) Mrs. Karen (MK) and Vice Principal (VP)

Story Start

In Senior Year I took a teaching class cause I considered being a teacher at one point, where you got to go teach in some of the nearby elementary and middle schools. The school schedule was an odd/even schedule meaning (for those of you who don't know) three classes each day with odd day attending 3rd, 5th and 7th classes and even day attending 2nd, 4th and 6th period classes. However before we could go out and teach in classes we had some reports we had to give in our class.

We all were given a week to write reports about topics of our choice about classrooms and I decided to be a bit bold and chose to do mine on special education (which is a sensitive and difficult topic that no other student thought of doing) and I made sure my report would knock it out of the park.

Each student went to the front of the class and gave their reports, and afterwards students listening were allowed to ask questions. I didn't raise my hand as much, until Jock gave his.

After Jock gave his report I raised my hand and asked a simple question only to be met with ""That is the most stupid question I ever heard!"" as the entire class laughed. I looked from him to the back of the teachers head in the front of the room who didn't respond as he continued, and without answering my question.

My turn to give my report and when I said it was about I saw the teachers eyes widen as I gave a great lecture, hitting all the high points like proper ways to address such things. When I finished there wasn't a single hand raised... except for one: The Jock

Jock: Why do we need to know any of these things? It's not like we're gonna be in a class with mentally retarded children like you.

I set my paper down on the podium and turn to the guy and said ""That was a stupid and rude comment."" before explaining why he would need to know those things before dropping my report into the basket with the rest and sitting down.

The next class we all got our reports back with mine with only a note in red ink saying ""Come see me after class."" I assumed that maybe I was gonna get some praise for tackling a difficult subject or something...

How wrong I was.

I approach the teachers desk after the bell rings while some of the students are still in the room.

MK: What you did in your report was very rude and unprofessional. i'm not sure this is the best class for you.

Me: What do you mean?

MK: The way you answered Jock's question was very rude and I don't think you're the right kind of person to be a teacher. I'm going to contact the office and request to have you removed from this class.

Me: And what about him? \*pointing to Jock standing by his desk\* You and everyone saw him to it to me first.

MK: I know, and i'm not going to punish him.

Me: So you're only going to punish me, that's bullshit.

MK: I will not be spoken to like that in my class. I will be contacting the office to have you removed and have you serve a detention. \*as she opened her desk\*

Me: We'll see about that. \*I turn and leave the room, walking past a classroom half full of students\*

I go up to the office and knock on my VP's open door to see him on his phone. He sees me and points to an open chair. He finishes he phone call and I guess who is on the other end as he talks

VP: You must be OP, I heard you made a disturbance in Mrs. Karen's class.

Me: It wasn't much of a disturbance, and I wasn't the only one. The other one did it and it was way worse. If i'm getting a detention he better get one too

VP: Another student yelled at the teacher?

Me: I didn't yell at the teacher.

VP: I'm confused. Who was yelling at who?

Me: Nobody was yelling

VP: Come back up to the office during lunch, I want to talk to you both.

I nod before reaching into my bag and pulling out my report and said ""You'll need this."" setting the report on the desk and walking out. Lunch comes and I go up to the office and in comes Mrs. Karen. VP guides us to his office and we sit down.

VP: Now Mrs. Karen could you explain what happened?

I sit and hear Mrs. Karen explain in great detail about how I gave my report and that afterwards I rudely snapped on Jock. Then today about how I was rude to her and that she put in a request during the previous break about removing me from the class and giving me a detention.

VP: \*turns to me\* is all that true?

Me: Yeah, but she missed out a couple things here and there.

VP: What things?

Me: Jock gave his report before me and said my question was stupid, only for everyone in class to laugh at me. I gave my report and he asked a question that was stupid and very disrespectful. And today she said I would be bad to this course even though I think I did a very good job on my report. On top of that she acknowledged in front of half the class that both me and Jock did the same thing to each other, but she only wants to punish me.

VP: Did he do a good job on his report?

MK: There's no doubt he did a good job on his report, it's his behavior that's the problem.

VP: Tell me about Jock, were you going to punish him as well?

MK: I don't think that'll be necessary.

VP: Go to lunch OP, and take your report back \*hands me back my report\* It was a very nice read.

I book it out of the room leaving Mrs. Karen and VP alone in the room

The next class Mrs. Karen announced that she will be going on maternity leave soon. I smirked as the teacher that replaced her was better. I decided to look my old school staff contact list and saw her name not on the list of teachers but in the list of ""other employees"" with the title ""Coordinator of Instructional Support""

Hope she learned something, cause I didn't learn a thing from her."
damned if i do damned if i dont,"so for context this teachers has always held a very noticeable grudge on me to the point where even when i do all my work on time and there's nothing missing he still gives me a shit grad. Now it does make seance why he dose not really like me because about a year ago i used to be a major dickhead in his class and not get anything done at all. But now i actually put in the effort and do all the work and be polite as possible and my grade is still the same as when i didn't do anything at all. Now for context for the image i was in school for most of the week and finished the entire weeks work 3 days before it was due... now after just doing nothing for 3 days cause well as i just said i did absolutely everything and there was no missing work i go back to virtual learning. Now for virtual learning for this class i will usual no do my work in the actual meeting i will do the work and get it done in time but i usually wait till after or do it before the meeting because i find it a huge distraction for me to have some one constantly talking about their personal life in the background of me trying to do work and getting a zero for dAiLy ParTiSiPaTiOn just because i muted the meet because it was to much of a distraction. Now Ive been doing this for a while and its never been a problem. Today however it is so i had a test and i will admit i should have done this in the google meet and its my fault for not doing it then when he wanted us to but i ended up doing it after the meet was over and letting him know it was done just to make sure he knows so it was done on time and no we didn't have to stream our screen or anything during the test so it had nothing to do with being able to cheat or anything the only difference is i did it after the meet. Now like i said before i emailed him to let him know it was done and the image is the response i got and he gave me a zero for the test and he obliterated my grade just because i did it after the meet how do you guys think i should respond to this? I feel like no mater what i say hes still going to find a way to shit on my grade and tell me all the reasons he thinks im a shit person.

Teacher Quits Job To Become YouTuber,
Middle school math teacher who had no business working with kids,"I had this teacher in 7th grade for algebra. Throughout the school year she was notorious for playing favorites and outright bullying kids that obviously just needed extra guidance. 

One of these kids, Shaun, was a boy who at the time everybody viewed as a troublemaker. He didn't put in a lot of effort to the class, and hung around a friend group who was likely a bad influence for him. One day, Shaun accidently broke an electric pencil sharpener. All eyes fell on him when the loud crash was heard in the quiet classroom. Mrs. C went BALLISTIC, and began shouting at him. She ordered everybody in the class to bring $2 in so that it could be replaced. I understand that teachers often have to pay for supplies out of pocket, but the torment she continued to lay into this boy was so over the top. Even other kids started to ridicule him with her. One of the girls who sat by Shaun chimed in and told Mrs. C that he stayed up until 4am the night before. Mrs. C laughed and continued berating him about how he isn't going to go anywhere in life, and obviously his parents didn't care enough about him to raise him properly. He took this with his head hanging low the whole time. 

Then Mrs. C started to hand out worksheets. Math isn't my strongest subject, and at the time I had very low self-esteem. The boys who sat around me would often snatch my tests and worksheets to show to others how many problems I had gotten wrong. I always stood up and snatched them right back without saying anything, just looking at them sternly. While doing these worksheets I always used my hands to cover my answers so nobody could see them. When Mrs. C came around to see how everyone was doing she stopped at my desk. I'm not sure what came over me to be honest, but when she tried to take my hands off of my paper I fought it. She yelled out in frustration and threw her hands up, saying she was just DONE. She went to her desk and sulked while the class just sat in silence. 

So yeah, fuck you Mrs. C. Learn some self control before working with kids."
Sewing Teacher ruins her subject for everyone else,"A conversation with friends recently dredged up the repressed memories I had from my old school and because this is reddit, I assume a few of you might get a kick out of me recounting absolute hell that was my eighth grade sewing class.

I went to a traditional catholic high school in the caribbean (ie one of the ‘good’ schools). My school being an all girls school that prided itself on having excellence as the standard and instructing phenomenal young women. The school had a mandatory sewing class in second form (eighth grade), and while most girls in my class groaned at the thought of having to sit over meticulous needle work and being made to use sewing machines that were likely older than us by a couple of decades, I was excited.

Part of my excitement came from the fact that I loved making little dresses for dolls out of whatever scraps of cloth I could find; I often asked my neighbour, a seamstress, to teach me basic stitches on her sewing machine, to which I was happily indulged. 
So this being a ‘Textiles and Clothing’ class, I was pumped to learn about clothing construction and how to properly use a sewing machine and all that. I was an ecstatic 13 year old entering what I thought would have been one of the greatest classes of my high school career. An easy pass for the year to make my report card look extra nice and a fun time,right? 

Well, I wouldn’t be posting here if it was now would I?

My teacher, we’ll address her as Ms. De Vil, was an awful teacher and an even worse human being.  We had her class first thing on a Wednesday morning. Her classroom was right infront of the staff room, so every Wednesday we’d wait a good 5-10 minutes outside the classroom, in a line, waiting for her to exit the staff room and make her way over to the class. Because god forbid we be in the classroom without her!

Whenever Ms. De Vil was in a bad mood, which was always, she’d lash out at us for the tiniest things. Even when the class was silent, she’d snap at someone for making ‘too much noise in her classroom’ or rag endlessly on girls who weren’t instantly good at sewing.
After all, why be miserable yourself, when you can spread your toxicity to young girls, who have nothing to do with your problems?

On top of that Ms. De Vil never taught a lesson herself. Why teach when you can let youtube videos and instruction sheets do it for you? When we needed assistance from her on how to complete a certain type of stitch or ask about a mechanic on the sewing machine, she’d condescendingly sneer and ask why we didn’t pay attention to the video as though she wasn’t being paid a salary to teach children how to sew. She was regularly snappish to me in particular, because I asked a lot of questions about the sewing machine and I also needed more help than some of my classmates to use it.

Also, god help you if you asked a more knowledgeable classmate for help with a stitch or something, then begins the rant about how ‘they’re not the teacher’ and ‘if you needed help you should have asked me’ and how us ‘young girls are so disrespectful’.
This of course was bs. She has no interest in helping us.

She also gave out punishments like candy. There was one specific class where she left to go to the staff room for a bit. When she left we remained silent and continued our work. Most other teachers would have been proud. When she returned she noticed that the ceiling fan was on. Not that her students were diligently and quietly doing their work, not that no girls were talking to each other, just the ceiling fan warranted her attention. So of course she then asked, who had turned the fan on. We couldn’t answer because no one did. She had left the fan on when she exited the room and even then it was an asinine question, who cares? 
We live in a tropical country the fan is usually on. Her response to the few brave souls who told her she left it on though? To call all of us liars and put the entire class in lunch detention for half an hour. For context we had just shy of an hour for lunch, and unlike schools elsewhere in the world, the entire school (almost 2000 girls+teachers) went for lunch at the same time. Leaving a class of 45 students 25 minutes to purchase and have something to eat.
Suffice to say everyone who had her, despised her."
1st grade teacher was awful for the whole year!,"So, in first grade i had just been diagnosed with autism. My 1st grade teacher thought it was fun to bully me when i could barely speak up because of my social awkwardness and anxiety.

She would yell at me, and one time she just socked me in the nose, making my head fly into the back of my seat. I hit my neck and could barely breath. She would also flick me really hard on the temple when i so much as colored the turkey the wrong shade of orange.

I heard about her dog getting hit by a car and having its leg crushed beyond repair, and i drew her something at the end of the year, saying ""have a good year with your dog!"" The picture said 'best teacher ever!' And showed her on her porch with her dog. She almost cried.

I forgave her for what she did then, but now i know how awful it was."
The justice system is trash,
Bad teacher but my favorite subject,"So in 8th grade currently my science teacher sucks however I love science it’s my favorite subject and I’m just gonna make a list of the things this teacher does
1.Plays favorites you could get an answer right but hell yep you no you’re wrong it’s not ___ and then calls on a favorite kid of his usally girls and asks them and they say what you said and he’s like Yeah!
2. Holds class longer than actually class by 2 minutes and we have 3 minutes to transition between classes
3.makes fun of students constantly to the point we’re ppl don’t laugh
4.when kids get answers wrong he treats them like idiots he’s super passive aggressive 
5. During online school until we went back he would KILL a kid if they didn’t have there fucking camera on like no camera no life
6. Also something weird he’s 57 and has a 6 year old daughter 
7.doesn’t explain or give help to students who really need it if they truly don’t understand something. If you miss one thing and ask him to explain briefly or privately later explain it he says figure it out yourself ik not responsible for that
8. Pressures kids who don’t answer his questions within 3 seconds 
9.acts like he knows everything an mf literlly says you guys will probably never ever understand any of what we’re learning 
10. Someone says and answers he doesn’t like? Well remotes in  a “ retard” tone
11. He’s just an asshole"
Crazy prek experience.. rude teachers,"This has happened in 2018, just venting.. Nothing personal against any teacher. My daughter had a bully in prek, actually 2. A little girl and a little boy. The little girl would call her names ""ugly"" and wouldn't share with her. I had to talk with my daughter to ignore her and find better friends and that her words dont matter. Now, this little boy would kick, scratch, and hit my daughter and it upset her as well as me. One day I picked her up and she's not her usual self, it was Friday and every friday if shes had a perfect week I'll but her a happy meal. So I buy her happy meal and wouldn't eat it and went straight to sleep, we assumed she was very tired. She woke up later that afternoon still not her happy self, she didnt even touch her chocolate milk from her happy meal and she loves her chocolate milk we knew something was wrong so dad and I immediately intervened. She said mommy my mouth hurts, I thought her tooth was loose so I take a closer look and see her bottom gumbs are bright red and looks sore. We asked what happened she said the little boy had scratched her in the mouth. She said this child put his fingers in her mouth and scratch her gumbs. I felt all my baby pain along with my anger, we asked did she do #1 tell the teacher, she says yes and the teacher gave her some ice to put on the bruise. Now if the teacher did do just that, why werent we notified with a call or note, we didnt recieved anything but to hear this from our 5 year old. We went out to the school Monday morning met her teacher at the door and told her our child wasn't herself friday and my child told her teacher what had happen. The teacher denikies knowing of any of this, my daughter interrupts and says you gave me ice remember? Teacher still denies it. So we left as if she gets the message were serious about our baby. She did include this information about the child, other parents are complaining about this child as well and I don't know what to say about his household. So 3 months goes by and everything is going good as far as the physical bruises. I get a phone call and the teachers says my child was bite by the little girl on the playground, she puts my child on the phone and shes clearly upsets and wants to come home. When I arrived at the school I told the administrators at the front desk what the matter was and one the administrators told me I need to have a talk with the principal about her with a look of seriousness in her face. I did exactly that. during the meeting it was another staff a older lady and I told my concerns and my frustrations. The principal said she will certainly handled the situation and to meet with her anytime. I felt relieved but the next day it gets weird. All the teachers didnt bother to get my child out the car during drop offs they would walk pass my car and the same during pick up, my child and I were completely ignored. I paid it no attention and started to walk my child in and walk in to pick her up. They would all stare and wouldn't greet me. I even noticed some rolling their eyes at me, I guess they wanted a reaction out of me so I completely ignored them. I rolled my eyes back! After they saw me not even acknowledging their behaviors they got an officer out there to intimidate me, he would only come out once he saw my vehicle pulling in. I guess they thought that would stop me from ignoring them but it didnt I even started to have conversations with him in the mornings and that drove them crazier. So now just about all the teacher and staff are giving me the evil eye and I haven't even disrespected anyone just did the right thing to protect my child. My child comes home and says the staff that was in the room when me and the principal that day had told her I dont like your momma. What a grown up thing to say to a child. My child has also said this staff would call me ugly and put her timeout allday for no reason and her teacher would tell that staff please leave her alone and they would laugh. I told my daughter as long as no one touches you again pay it no mind but always keep us informed. This teacher has also said talked about me to the other parents, some had came back to tell me. Now school is finally over and I'm so happy she doesn't have to go that school anymore. Shes going to kindergarten to a different school. As soon as I starts walking my daughter into her classroom the staff there all looked at me as if they were a deer in headlights. I loved walking my daughter to her class, one staff walked pass other parents and came to me and said I'll walk her down for you as if they didnt want me involved in my own child. So it came to my mind they informed this new school about me as if I made a big horrible scene at her old school. I remember picking up my daughter early because I had an obgyn appointment (yes I'm pregnant 7 months) and they all looked at me crazy and later that day they send out pre recorded automatic calls and the principal says remember parents to pick your child up between these times etc...if you have anything to do or a doctors appointment come early. I knew they were talking about me. Those teachers at that prek really slandered my name and I thought about getting a lawyer. A couple months goes by and I had my second child abd goes out to my daughter award ceremony, those teachers jaws literally dropped in guilt. Knowing they were precipitating in drama and lies. I carried my pregnancy very good so they really couldn't tell. After that ceremony those teachers at my daughter new school actions immediately changed towards me and I guess they told those teachers at that prek because they were popping up on my people you may know list on Facebook and I BLOCKED the brakes out of them lol!
They all look foolish for involving in that low vibrational energy. It was all a lie to make me look bad all because I ratted out a lacking teacher. I've seen parents go completely crazy verbally and even physically. I kept my composure and remained a adult and they flipped it all on me to be this big mad angry woman.
Updated: I saw one of the prek teachers at Walmart I smiled at her and before I could realize who she was she turned her nose up at me like she could kill me but spoke to my daughter(hey baby) my daughter didn't open her mouth.
Do you guys feel those teachers were assholes? Feedback is welcome!"
Just happened today- I am pissed,"In algebra,all my class did was get reemed out because we all did awful on the test. Retakes tomorrow,should be fun (not)
8 people failed. Highest was a 89 which was Jenna,who is the smartest girl in our class.
She got after us because she thought a lot of us cheated or used quizlet (none of us trust quizlet to give us answers to our math questions,so that's just a frickin' theory she made up)
So we all did awful and she mixed up the questions (like usual,because she thinks that it somehow proves her theory) which according to her logic means that we just copied off of someone who had the opposite test or we used the original version from quizlet
Austin,a boy in my class, had a question on something but heaven forbid that he worded it as ""I compared with my neighbors paper and we had different answers,but she got it right but I got it wrong even though hers wasn't right either."" (Jenna was beside him,so they both had different questions [which Austin didn't understand]). And she was like ""Oh,so you were looking at someone else's paper?"" Austin meant he compared with Jenna's test while we were all looking over them after they were graded. She says she doesn't stand for gossip and if there was an issue,she would speak to us alone but that's apparently a frickin' lie because she was very loud about it
So Austin got in trouble for something he didn't do,which was blatantly obvious to everyone else,because she couldn't take a second to access the situation or take a chill pill.
Normally I don't like Austin (we've never gotten along [he's surprisingly been a lot better recently tbh,so we're more acquaintances now]) but I'm on his side this time"
4th Grade Teacher Shames Students,"I do not give permission for others to use or reproduce this story on any medium.   


4th Grade. I don't have a solid memory of it, much like most of my early school life, but my mother does because the teacher was proud enough to brag about it to my parents. We had a test one day, not sure which subject as we had the same teacher all day at that grade level, and we all took it and turned it in. The next day she handed the tests back to everyone... Everyone but me.   


She held the only test she hadn't handed out up in front of the entire class and said how it was the only one to get every answer correct and earned a perfect score. She told the whole class that it was my test and that I had gotten that perfect score. She then proceeded to crumple the test into a ball and throw it in the trash, then turned back to announce that she would be grading the test as a zero because I had forgotten to put my name on the paper.   


I was the only one who didn't get a test back, so it was obviously mine, but she decided she'd rather give a child mental scarring by publicly shaming them, than to take a few points off and use her (theoretically) higher cognitive prowess to determine that it belonged to the only student she didn't have a grade for.   


Later in life, halfway through my senior year of high school (year 13 in the UK I believe), I went to a therapist because I was having trouble paying attention in class. Forgetting answers, missing homework, not paying attention, and so on, for most of my schooling but it was really starting to show now and some of my teachers were concerned. My mom went in with me for the meeting and when we were asked when we first noticed the issues starting we started going back through my school history and trying to pin it down. That was when my mom remembered the above incident and others like it and voiced her thoughts of them possibly being the trigger.   


When we told the therapist the name of the school... she immediately knew the teacher's name. Apparently they had gotten a lot of former students of that teacher who had come through their office. She had messed up so many lives because, as it turned out, she was a mental abuser and would pick out some students from each year in her class (always boys) to torment for that year. Obviously the therapist couldn't give us many details, but it was both distressing and a relief to know that I wasn't the only one this happened to. That it wasn't just because it was me.  


The only interaction I can still remember having with that teacher was when she told me that I was not allowed to take home the unused math problem sheets (they were random problems on each sheet) that were going to recycling. She had initially allowed me to since I liked math and doing so would give me more practice. I guess I showed that I liked it too much so she took that little bit of happiness away too. Most of my childhood around and before that time is a complete blank to me now, with only a few stray moments sticking out. I still vaguely remember her face though (black, shoulder-length hair, long face, dark eyes, long thin nose, tallish even for an adult), but I can't remember my grandfather's face who passed shortly before this time.   


I've had other bad teachers, but this was the worst, and likely what triggered my lack of attention going forward in my schooling. Why bother doing the work if the teacher is just going to belittle you and grade you unfairly regardless? It was one teacher, but it was for an entire school year while I was young. It left its scars. Many years after I was out of school I found out from my mother that this teacher had died of cancer. I just smiled a bit and replied, ""Ding, dong, the witch is dead."" My very religious mother didn't even try to scold me. She just said that she figured my reaction would be along those lines.   


Note: I don't blame my parents for waiting so long to realize there was a problem as awareness of issues like these was still rather new at the time. Also, I know cancer is no joke as I have family members living with it and some who have passed from it, but this woman ruined me (and others) in so many ways that it still affects me as an adult almost three decades after it happened."
"Catholic school, fourth grade","I was a very smart kid. When I was in fourth grade in a Catholic school, a teacher's aide took me aside to tell me that the boys would never like me if I was too smart. She didn't know that I was great friends with all the boys in my class; the girls and I didn't get along. And I have the last laugh, since I'm aromantic asexual."
Driving instructor rude at me because I told him I can't attend the morning classes,"I am a working woman and not a morning person. I wanted a driving licence and I approached nearest driving instructor. 

I felt a negative vibe when I first met him, his demeanor and words were seemingly undermining my abilities to handle a vehicle. When I asked him that I could only attend evening classes because I will be too tired early in the morning, he made a snobbish comment against my job (I am a computer professional) and said he can't change his plans. In the end, I agreed because I wanted the licence badly.

I started attending the class for few days and I felt he was impatient with me, making me nervous and overall incompetent. I learned riding two wheelers within a month and received the licence the week following, so I know learning a four wheeler wouldn't be that hard but he's treating me like I am stupid. If I am too slow and confused about the changing gear, he immediately scolded me and one time he made a remark about my weight. One time, we passed a boutique which sold branded clothes, he asked me if I go there. I told him no. He said, 'Oh, I I thought you were kind of person who goes there'. I immediately knew he saw me as one of those well off lazy women who have no talents. I felt more and more hesitant to continue the class due to his rudeness.

My friends and family were coaxing me to continue the class and I didn't want endure his bullying. As a result, I missed most of his classes. Then one day, I took a huge leap of courage and went to his class after a month. Big mistake. He was more  rude than ever. He told me to stop the car when I hit brake earlier than intended to, he made me sit in the back of the car until he instructed rest of the students. When they left, he said I 'forgot everything' and I needed to learn everything from the start all because I put the brakes early. 🤦 He even said he had no interest in teaching me because I missed classes. Well, if he had been professional and polite towards me and didn't act like a dick, I would have attended the class. 

Then corona came and I couldn't attend his class when government ordered to close all driving schools. When they reopened, he didn't bothered to call me eventhough I asked him to remind me once they reopen the business. And I didn't bothered to go back because I am not interested in his unprofessional teaching."
Embarrass a kid for finger tracking when reading,"Background: In my schools there was always reading out parts of a textbook to the rest of the class. But in primary school it was in smaller groups of maybe 5 or 6, and the teacher, just reading a normal story together. 

In P7, or at 11 years old, I was struggling to know which parts of the book were being read, and had difficulty keeping up. So I used my finger to keep track of the words cause it helped me focus on each individual word, rather than the whole page.
The teacher did NOT like that. I was apparently too old to have to follow with my finger. They loudly called attention to it and the rest of the class laughed at me for doing something ""a baby"" has to do.

Thing is.....i had undiagnosed dyslexia.

I only got diagnosed just over a year ago. I'm 21 now. That teacher destroyed my love of reading for a long time. When I started reading for fun again, I was much slower. I still am. 

It also took me nearly a decade to not be completely self-conscious when reading in public. And I'm finally accepting the fact that there's nothing wrong with place tracking when reading, which means I can actually do my university reading

F you Mrs. M"
Two Teachers Said/Made S--cudal Motions/Words To Me,"These are pretty recent. The first story happened last year and the second story was yesterday.

My science teacher said something towards me and my group table. ""It would be a miracle if I could go this year without slitting my wrist."" She was talking about herself. She was a good teacher, very pretty, actually taught us, and overall a great teacher. She must have been having a bad day because later that day, when she heard a student got rejected and went to the bathroom to cry she says, ""Good. Someone needs to teach him a lesson."" 

 A substitute did the gun to his head motion. I wasn't with him at the time, I was eating lunch in the hallway with my music teacher. (Because not all classes could eat in the cafeteria due to the virus and she doesn't have desk.) His class passes us, he's in the back. My teacher says something he says something. Then when he's walking away he does a gun motion to his head and makes a motion like he was shooting himself. My teacher seemed to find it funny but me and my classmates just kinda.... sat there."
I think this is supposed to be here....,
My 3rd Grade English Teacher That Was Always Mean: Part 2,"   One month passes, and I forget to do my homework for the 2nd time. I ask my friends if they had done the homework, but most of them hadn’t either, so I was happy that I wasn’t alone.

T: Can I have your homework?

Me: I forgot...

T: Ugh! Everyone that has forgotten their homework go to the front of the class, RIGHT NOW!!

   I was really confused, because this was only my 2nd time forgetting, but I went to the front of the class anyway. There were about 7 other people at the front with me. It was my lucky day! Almost half the class had forgotten their homework with me!

T: I’m so disappointed! I’m going to call N to see what she says!

   T comes back with N a minute later.

T: See? All of these students, haven’t done their homework!

N: Oh my...

   N was an OK teacher, but she was pretty strict, so she went ahead and started telling all the students how she didn’t expect this of them.

N: S1, I thought you were responsible! S2, Idk how you could do this!

   And then she gets to me...

N: OP! I didn’t expect this from you AT ALL! I thought you were a good student!

   I glared at her, even if I was in 3rd grade, my ability to hate people was VERY strong. I thought that this was really stupid. Just because I forgot my homework 2 times meant that I was suddenly a terrible student.

T: Come outside with me.

   We went outside, I was now glaring at the back of her head.

T: There has to be a punishment for this, and I want you guys to tell me what you want it to be. Make it reasonable!

   First of all, this is a pretty dumb thing to ask students. Why would they want to pick what “reasonable“ punishment they ought to get? I couldn’t think of anything, so I stayed quiet.

S1: How about drawing?

   *I hate drawing.*

T: I think that is too easy.

   *Yes!*

S2: How about reading?

   *Please be reading...* I didn’t want reading because I could get away with *not* reading, I wanted reading because I LOVED and still love reading.

T: Umm... Still too easy.

   *Then why don’t you pick?*

TM: How about we do a poster about a story we read?

   *OMG, no!*

T: Great idea! You guys will do the homework you missed, Wednesday’s homework, and do a poster about a short book on the weekend. Also, please do the extra homework sheets either for the homework you missed or Wednesday’s homework. You will have to present your posters on Monday!

   Great, we had to do an Extra homework packet, Tuesday *and* Wednesday’s homework, read a book and make a poster, and we had to present that! Just because we missed *one* day’s homework!

   My week was ruined and I had to work on the poster on the weekends. I showed up to class the next Monday and presented, and I hated T more than ever.

   At the end of the year, we realize that T had been lying to us about how she couldn’t speak Mandarin. We got excited and started speaking Mandarin to her, but she got MAD, and told us to speak English! That was when I decided that no matter what interesting thing happens related to her, I wouldn’t be speaking to her anymore, and I didn’t! I moved to Canada for grade 4 and am still living there.

&#x200B;

**Bonus:**

  At the end of the year, T gave us cards so that our parents could contact the school and  sign us up for the next year.

T: OP, take this card.

Me: I don’t need to, we are moving to Canada.

   T was obviously annoyed for some reason, maybe because she wouldn’t get to bully me anymore.

T: No you’re not! Just take it!

   I wanted to laugh so bad, because even then, I knew she was annoyed.

Me: I don’t need it! I’m not gonna come here anymore!

   T just shoves the card in my hand, which I find pretty rude, so I decide to do something. I wouldn’t do this if I didn’t know we were moving or if it wasn’t the last day.

Me: Thanks!

   I walk straight to the trash can, and throw the card away, and T is SUPER annoyed.   
T: WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!

Me: I already told you, I don’t need it because I’m moving!

   And since it was almost the end of the day, I go and pack my stuff and go down to the front of the school and wait for my mom.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

My 3rd grade English teacher sets unreasonable rules, lies to us, punishes us for absurd things, and gets annoyed when I tell her that I’m going to move to Canada.   


There are still some stuff that I haven’t included. I don’t know if many people will see this, but if you do, and want to hear some other stuff about T, please tell me! Thank you for reading!"

My 3rd Grade English Teacher That Was Always Mean: Part 1,"Hi, I just wanna say that this is my first post and I’m still learning how to use Reddit. Ok, let’s start with the story.

&#x200B;

**Backstory:**

   I‘m born in a country where English isn’t our first language (but my parents decided to move so my English is a lot better now) so, we had English classes teaching us how to properly talk English. I don’t really know if the country you’re born in is personal information but I’d rather not give it out so I’m going to choose a random country. Let’s say... *Singapore.* Since Mandarin is the most popular language in Singapore, I’m gonna say that mostly everyone in school spoke Mandarin.

   This story happened when I was in 3rd grade, and the school I went to was pretty strict. I never really had a problem with this though, I was used to it. Anyway, we had English classes for 3 hours at the end of the day. Our school was open from 7:30 to 3:30 so, at that point, everyone was tired and just wanted to go home. 

   Now, at this school, the students in a class didn’t change much, so everyone knew each other when they went to the next grade. For some reason, EVERY class I’m in has some kind of problem with it. Either everyone is noisy, unruly, the teachers are bad, etc. The thing with this class was that our grade 1 teacher stopped coming to school for some reason, and the same substitute taught us for more than half the year. The substitute was really nice, but she didn’t really *teach* us anything. Because of this, when we got to grade 2 and had a proper teacher, she had to teach us grade 1 stuff, so we ended up being a year behind the other classes.

   Then we get to grade 3, and this is where the story starts.

  
**Cast:**

T: *English Teacher*

N: *The Teacher That Teaches Almost Everything In Elementary School* 

S1, S2, S3...: *Students*

Me: *Me*

TM: *Trouble Maker*

**Story:**

   We get to grade 3 and everything is fine until it’s time for English class. We meet our English Teacher and she wastes no time in telling us that we needed to speak English in her classes at ALL TIMES. This was new to us, and a lot of us thought it was going to be hard, since we were still at a grade 1 English level. We told T this, and asked her if we could talk Mandarin, but she said that she couldn’t understand Mandarin and that we needed to be respectful to her.

   She then started listing some of the other rules. Some were reasonable, like silent reading English books for 10 minutes before starting class, and some were absolutely stupid, like having to get to the class 5 minutes early, with a new silent reading book, and all of our textbooks ready on our desk.

   This might sound reasonable to some of you, but here is why is wasn’t:

In my school, we had to eat the food the school provided, unless we had a note from a doctor explaining why we couldd’t eat the food. Aside from the fact that the food was HORRIBLE except for 2 dishes that I loved, it was usually served a few minutes late. Now, a lot of people in my class were super slow eaters, so we needed as much time as we could get to eat. But, with this new rule, we had to rush to eat our food so that we had an extra 10 minutes to get books, go to the bathroom (because she wouldn’t let us during her class), and get our books out of our lockers. If we were late, she locked the door and we would have to stay OUTSIDE for the LESSON! See how this is unfair yet?

&#x200B;

   The first day is basically us arguing with her about how we don’t know English as well as the other classes. So we come back the second day, and at English class, she tells us that we are going to have to study for the upcoming spelling test. Understandable, until we get the practice sheet, and there are SENTENCES! Now, these sentences are like “I like bananas and strawberries“, but keep in mind that we were still at grade 1 English skill level and had only written single words for spelling tests before.

   A week passes, and it’s time for the spelling test, which I get a terrible grade on... And then T gives us another spelling test with more sentences. Whatever. A month passes, and T decides to give us homework. This would be normal in the U.S. or Canada, but not in “Singapore” and we already had about 5 other subjects we were studying and had homework in. Yes, IK, 5 subjects for 3rd graders! She gives us homework two times a week, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.

   The homework is split into two groups, A and B. A homework was for people that were better at English, and B homework was for people that needed a bit more practice. I was in A, so the homework was harder to do, and took more time.   
   A few months pass, and I forget to do my homework for the first time. T comes to me and asks where my homework is.

T: Where is your homework, OP?

 Me: I forgot it...

T: Since this is your first time, you can get away with it, but don’t forget again.

   A few more months pass, and me and my friends start cheating in the spelling tests by writing the words on the table under our paper before the test started. I still can’t believe I cheated but... I was in grade 3 and the tests were too hard, I guess...

Please check out part 2!"
My Teacher Made Me Faint Then Blames Me,"I had a teacher in high school refuse to let me leave the classroom until I finished my work. I was about to faint and had a 504 (A list of my accomodations that the teachers had to follow by law) that said I could leave the class at anytime. I didn't want to make a scene so I just said I wasnt feeling well but she clearly didnt care and just told me to finish my work and went back to playing candy crush. I am not confrontational but I did not want to stay in that class room. I knew that if I didn't take action right then I would faint and I would rather do it in an empty hallway than a room full of desks with sharp corners. So, I left the class room. (This part was told to me by a friend) Apparently I fainted as soon as I made it into the hallway. The teacher followed me yelling at me to get back into the class room or go to the principles office. Then she realized what had happened and immediantly went into the defensive saying that she didn't know I was ill. My friend was amazing and called my parents while keeping everyone away from me. The teacher kept on trying to make me sit up (never do this because it can cause brain damage) but my friend did her best to get her off of me. By the time I woke up the nurse was there and the vice principle and the teacher was back in the classroom. Sadly, nothing ever happened to the teacher other than a scolding about the 504 plan. I wish I could say she learned her lesson but she seemed to think that she was the victim because she had it out for me for the rest of the year."
We all know racist teachers exist,I want to make a rant about this does anyone else think that teachers fail students because they are racist I'm not white students and ever since I graduate high school I have been doing a lot of research it seems like teachers they don't like their students if they're not smart enough I have a learning disability and when I was in special education classroom I noticed how teachers they were treating me different they will always complain how I was always having an attitude since I wasn't I don't know if this can be the reason why I felt I School and my teacher they didn't want to work with me does anyone else sing that racist teachers filled with doing it on purpose and get them in trouble
This fucking examiner,"I'm in Year 10 (First day in Year 11 is in a few days), and I got an E in English. Idk what happened. I did pretty well on the exam. Clearly they sent my exam to some people at Harvard or some shit. So now I had to endure my mum yelling at me"
My second grade teacher absolutely hated me part 1,"For context, I am on the autism spectrum and I have inattentive adhd (at the time I wasn’t diagnosed yet), which may help explain my behaviour. I also have a hard time apologizing, even though I am sorry (this is important later)

So we had a substitute teacher who was filling in for our regular teacher, who had a baby sometime the previous year and was gone until late in the school year. We’ll call the sub Miss R, she hated me for some reason, I still can’t figure out why she hated me in particular.

One time Miss R was out of the class and we were doing a worksheet of some kind, some kid was talking about how the pinky is basically the middle finger in China. Me not knowing that the middle finger is offensive, I flipped off my entire class and said “this is the real middle finger”. Some kid went to go get Miss R and I was forced to apologize to the entire class. I was never told what I did wrong, I started crying because of the pressure and attention that was on me, she still glared at me. Idk how long I sat there, it felt like an eternity and we missed gym because of it. She was blaming me for us missing gym class"
My POS of a substitute teacher.,"This was when I was in the 4th and 5th grade. There was this popular (not in a good way) sub that we would always have. She would tell the class to talk to their partners and then say that their talking was rude. If your leg hurt? Deal with it. wrongly graded? Deal with it. I somehow got on her good side (she picked favorites btw). My friend did not. The following conversation went like this according to my friend as I was sick that day.

Sub: Alright, do everything in your work packets.

The work packet said to write a story about a family member that lives in South America.

Friend: Can it be made up?

Sub: No.

Friend: But I don't have family in South America.

Sub: Well figure it out!

I really don't understand what went through her mind but she was awful. Teachers should be helping students learn and guiding them down the right path of their education. NOT running classes like POW camps.

Hope you liked my story. Have a nice day!

Edit: I forgot to mention, Frick you Mrs. Acton."
P.E. teacher shaming me,"This is gonna be a short post, but here goes. Last school year we were doing push-ups in P.E. and I'm... well, not exactly Mr. Muscles. We were told to do 10 push-ups and I couldn't do one. P.E. teacher: ""LegoRuby360 can't even do one push-up. Pathetic.""

I don't have very good self esteem about my body and this did not help."
Spanish Teacher Swore in front of 6th Graders and Got Away Scott Free,"Context: Nobody takes her class seriously. It's the exact same curriculum year after year. Same basic colors from kindergarten to 6th grade. We usually just goof off, and most people I know are switching to French next year.

Senora Bitch did NOT like this. She showed us the same cartoon she showed to the kindergarteners earlier, and we all cracked up, it was so dumb.

Us: \*Laughing\*

Senora: NOTHING IS FUCKING FUNNY!

The class went dead silent. Our homeroom teacher was also in the room grading papers.

And then, guess what?

WE GET SCOLDED.

School sucks :)"
Bad Principal,"When I was  like 7 I moved to Dearborn Michigan and went to a school named graham I was in 3 grade so I was fairly young and I suffer from aspergers bipolar disorder add adhd and autism so I’m already struggling in school anyways and have meltdowns every other day for random reasons and this absolute asshole pinned me up on the wall screams at me throws me out by my arm so I run off into 
The streets a teacher sees me calls the cops and I almost went to juvie for something I could not control"
Had a Physics teacher who had no regard for IEPs,"So back when I was in highschool, I had a pretty ableist teacher. 

She always had these timed tests, right? So around the beginning of the semester she told this story about a kid who lost their memory every 15 minutes, but because they took thorough notes and did what they were supposed to do in class they could finish the test in time without extended time, so no one else in class had an excuse to need extra time if they did what they were supposed to in class. 
Honestly; why the hell did someone with actual brain damage not have an IEP and extended time? And how would that even work? Hey you lost your memory?? Here let me just remind you you're in physics and you have to do this test and you gotta flip through your notes and- It sounds like a wild case. 

But because of this, she refused to give students with IEPs extended time and one time a student literally had to go to the principal and have them tell her she's required to be allowed extended time for her to grant it. She also gave me shit for being in the nurse's office during her period when I had PE prior (we had a roach problem, I have severe allergies to roaches, so it would trigger my lungs to burn up, I would get cold sweats, etc.) as if I could control the fact her class was after. I didn't want to be sick all the time either, thanks."
My P.E. teacher is an asshole,"So, my P.E. teacher hates me (and probably everyone else). This Wednesday as well as yesterday we had to run around the playground four times while it was really fucking hot. After the first one, I alread had trouble breathing, and I had a headache, my stomach, and my throat hurt, so I asked him if I could get my drink. He just said, and I quote, ""No, you have to keep going. If you complain again, you have to run around the playground 10 more times."" (Yes, he actually said that.) Yesterday, we had to run for an hour and walk through a forest for another hour right after AND go back to school (all while wearing masks of course). Yeah, I think you can guess how that goes.

He actually said that 3 people already passed out during P.E. (school just started last Monday), so yeah."
teacher threw me againts a wall,"so I know what this sounds like but hand on stay with me .

So this happened during grade 1. I remember this but is a little foggy but I got last week that it happned and my mom went to the school about it. but lets get to the juicy part. so my day started normal as always but my good friend, lets call her sara was sitting on the wall. of course I went over and ask what was wrong she gave me the look like she was dissapointed but before she answered a teacher came over and told me don't talk to her. this was what I remember that probbly led to getting abused. there might have been other stuff to but that I don't remember. but clearly remeber me getting slamed againts a wall but this may have been a dream so don't get mad. anyway that may have caused childhood trauma dream or not  I will never forget that smug white with silver hair ass face. 

I allow any youtuber to use this story just send a link to me so I can watch it thx"
When a teacher becomes a bully,"This happened to my brother when he was in year 5 ( I live in the UK so it is our equivalent of whatever the academic year of 9-10 year olds is called )

My brother, let's call him Mark (not actual name) , had started his new year terribly his teacher actively encouraged bullying towards Mark done by other students and she would also join in. My mother told the school multiple times about it and they would do nothing. My mother confronted the teacher and she didn't deny it and said that my brother overexaggerated. We moved school not long after (me being 2 years younger). Funny thing is we found out that the teacher actually moved school after we left and moved to the school that my cousin was at and became her teacher. My cousin gave that teacher a bad time after what she did to my brother."
Eighth Grade Choir,"To this day I still hold a grudge against my eighth grade choir teacher for two things. First thing, one time we had a Saturday choir concert.  I woke up that morning with a terrible stomach flu. Talking both ends, nonstop, and my mom actually took me to the hospital that night. My mom tried calling my teacher, but she still gave me an F with no opportunity of some sort of make up because I “skipped” the concert. Didn’t care I was in the hospital. Second thing, I used to sing fairly well and at high notes without my voice cracking. But when I had bronchitis for two weeks, she forced me to sing at the same levels as before. Reprimanded me if she could I wasn’t singing. Now when I sing I have to be careful with what notes I do. Otherwise my voice will crack or I’ll choke a little from my throat stalling. I love to sing, I just wish I could do so without pain in some songs."
The time my Social Studies Teacher called out my friends breasts twice in front of the whole class then shamed her for it,"Yes this is the same Social Studies Teacher as this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/badteachers/comments/bwca26/social_studies_teacher_does_nothing_to_help_me_in/

This isn't technically my story but a former friend of mine. But we have grown apart since High school and I was there during this and it's just personally made me so mad.

Cast
FF: Former friend
SST: Social Studies Teacher

So FF and I were in 11th grade and in the same Social Studies class. We were very different people but we're very close at the time.

One day FF came to school with a shirt that had a bit of a lower neckline but she was wearing a tank top under it. It was perfectly fine with our dress code. Should have no problems.

Word being SHOULD.

We get to Social Studies and are sitting at our desks. We start taking notes so FF leans forward to write. The desktop comes to just below her chest.

Now my FF was pretty average high school girl body at this time. Not super thin but not overweight. Her chest as pretty normal as well. She never flaunted her body as most girls in our school did.

As she does this I noticed that SST was straight up staring at FF's chest. Not even trying to hide it. He goes on with the notes for a few slides then suddenly says out loud...in front of the whole class..

""FF. You shouldn't sit like that. I can see your chest.'

My FF looked up and was just red with embarrassment. She leaned back and kept taking notes.

SST finished slides and had us reading from the textbooks.

As FF is reading, SST comes over to her desk and stands right beside her. He suddenly says out loud ""Yeah you shouldn't be wearing that. I can see your chest.""

Then he walked away. FF was so upset. She didn't look up for the rest of class.

At the end of class as FF was leaving SST told her she shouldn't be sitting in the way that she did or be wearing that shirt if she didn't want him to see her chest.

We both went to the guidance counselor and Principal but we're told ""No harm done""

My FF never wore that shirt to school again.

It angers me to this day that he could get away with saying these things to her in front of the whole class then have the GUTS TO TELL HER THAT IF SHE HADN'T BEEN SITTING A CERTAIN WAY OR WEARING A CERTAIN ITEM OF CLOTHING then he wouldn't have been staring at her chest."
Accused of being a drug addict by my assistant principal,"I saw someone else post about their teacher not believing their mental health issues and this reminded me of my own story with the assistant principal. 

Let's call him Mr. J. I have chronic pain and was in and out of hospitals for it along with bad anxiety and depression that was caused by my fully body nerve injury. I had a 504 plan and an IEP, basically legal papers saying I get some exceptions due to emotional and physical disabilities. 

One day after school ends I am in the hall way and fighting with my boyfriend (who liked to remind me my mental illness wasn't real, not a good guy) and I went into the bathroom to cry and I started hyperventilating. I tried to leave the bathroom but ended up passing out in the door way with a handful of tissues (important) because I was crying and passed out before I could throw them away. My boyfriend left me there and Mr. J ended up finding me. He told me to get up and we were going to his office. Now he was a stern man and not very nice at all, but I thought he was being nice by bringing me into a private setting to calm down. Boy I couldn't be more wrong. 

On the way to his office I threw out the tissues I had in my hand from the bathroom into a trashcan, he immediately demanded to know what I threw in the trash and didn't believe me when I told him snotty tissues even though I was still crying and using them up until I threw them out. He believed there were drugs in the tissues and made me dig through the garbage (that had been used all day) to prove to him they were just snotty tissues. 

In his office he told me anxiety and depression isn't real and I can't fool him. He knows I am a drug addict. I tried to tell him I have an IEP to help support me. He then pulled up security tapes of me leaving different classrooms to go to the bathroom or walk around the hallway. I tried to tell him part of my help I need that is written in my file is that I need to get up to walk. My legs don't work well and I recently had just learned to walk again, if I sat for too long my legs would go numb and I would be stuck in the classroom so teachers allowed me to stand up in the back of the room or when students were doing their own work I could go for a quick walk. As long as I got my work in teachers didn't mind if I left. I explained to him I stayed after school a lot to catch up on missed work or lessens. If I went to the bathroom it was because of my anxiety or my nerve injury was causing me to spasm and I did not want others to see me. He told me for a junkie I could come up with pretty good lies. He said he saw I was in a rehab hospital so he knows I have a history of addiction, I tried to tell him there are different types of rehab hospitals and the one I was in was to help me learn how to live my life again and I was with kids in remission from cancer and burn victims, not addicts. 

He calls my mom and tells her she needs to pick me up, she asked why because I had a car at school. He told her I wasn't allowed to drive. Worried that it was because of my nerve injury she dropped everything to pick me up. She was furious when she found out he was accusing me of doing drugs. She told him if he looked at my file he'd see what I struggled with and it was everything but addiction. Thats when he reiterated that mental illness isn't real and she told him it was and if he doesn't believe in it he still needs to treat me with respect and like an addict. He informed her I was not allowed to drive my car or come back to school with out a clean drug test. The next day I went to school to talk to the guidance counselor and she told me I had every right to go to class. There was a meeting held later that day with my mom and the gc, all of my teachers, and Mr. J who all informed him of my situation. My mom reiterated I had a legal right to do what I was doing and if he tried to interfere or accuse me of anything again I had a lot more people on my side than he would on his. 

He also accused of my friend of doing drugs because she had schizophrenia and claimed that mental illness isn't real and you don't hallucinate without illegal substances. She was much better at standing up for herself than I did. I ended moving schools after my junior year (when he accused me) was over because my parents realized I was not in a good place if someone at the head of the school threw accusations around and didn't believe in mental illness."
My teacher shamed me for having Mental Health Problems,"I wish she could just rot in hell. Everyone seems to consider her a nice teacher but I would never forget how she treated me after she knew I was practicing self harm. She asked me why and when I told her it was because of my past traumas and insecurities, she told me I was overreacting. I was crying so hard and she was so mad. She didn't know how she further worsened my situation. She shamed me in the faculty room. She told me that all my classmates were fine and that I was the only one that is messed up. She even scared me than she will make me transfer schools if I continue this behavior. I was so scared and hurt. I never got the chance to fight because she was a teacher and if I fought back, my grades would be affected. I have so much hate and anger for her. And I hate it that some students think that she's a fucking angel when she's not!! She's a devil inside and she acts like she's the kindest fucking teacher in school!"
Blatant Misinformation from Anatomy Teacher,"My school’s chemistry teacher started teaching an anatomy class as an elective for students who have completed the compulsory science classes. In addition to having no cohesive curriculum and deciding what she’s going to teach based on whatever non-fiction book she’s been reading at the moment (sometimes it has nothing to do with anatomy), she also frequently tells us things that are obviously incorrect. A few gems that stand out:
1) If you meditate and imagine yourself lifting weights or doing push-ups you gain muscle strength.
2) Cancer patients die because they have a negative attitude about their situation and that weakens their immune system.
3) And, most recently, autism is caused by the bacteria in your digestive tract."
Teacher wants to ruin me and my best friend's friendship.,"Sorry for bad grammar or spelling. Call me out if you want

This may not be the worst teacher on this subreddit, and also i only have one example, 

I'll call myself Mia, my best friend will be best friend and i'll call the teacher Miss Pink, because she is obsessed with pink.

&#x200B;

Last year, Miss Pink didn't have any problems with me or my friend. But now, we both got closer to eachother the teacher started complaining about us being together too often. Note: We have been best friends our entire childhood. This was the one time that hurt the most: Every new year, we celebrate inside our classroom. We put all the desks together in the center and our chairs around it, we also eat breakfast at school. After we ate breakfast we had a few moments to chat. After that we watch a movie and after that we say 2 things that we will try to do better/different this year and end with opening presents for our randomly selected classmates (secret santa). It was my best friend's turn to open her present, she couldn't come up with the 2nd thing she wanted to try and do different. Miss Pink, says loudly to the entire class: ""You should try to communicate more with your classmates. But not Mia"". Me and my best friend just stared at the teacher for a split second and proceed to just be completely silent, after a few seconds she opens still opens her gift. Even though i know those words didnt come from my best friend, and i know she's never gonna say something like that, it hurt. I had to hold in tears, yet dont know why i had to cry. 

I know i may seem kinda rude and selfish, but i'm actually quite happy that the virus allows us to stay home, away from this teacher. Here are 3 other things because the teacher seems to have a problem with me. (She has only said these things about me, not anyone else)

*-She says shes allergic to my hair.* ***Only*** *my hair.*

*-She wants* ***me*** *to stop wearing a choker because it's ""A dangerous thing to wear"". It's defenitly not.*

*-She wants* ***me*** *to stop wearing a mask because it's ""Scaring smaller children"". Once again, defenitly not. It's a mask i got at a con. It has a bear nose on it, yet the smaller children say it looks like a kitty nose.*"
Due to quarantine all the subject teachers of my school are trying their best to teach us except our physics teacher. She just straight up gave notes in pdf and now taking a test,
My Worst Middle School Experience - DISCLAIMER (not too horrible but still my worst),"We had a really cool and funny teacher for Computers class and she was really funny when it came to joking around. So I liked her a lot, like everyone else. We thought we had lucked out. But suddenly, down to the last couple of weeks of school she, for no reason of my knowledge, starts picking on me. A couple of incidents that I remember specifically, I honestly can't believe I still remember her name and the thing that happened as it was years ago.

I come in earlier to the class than usual and so she's sitting in the computer room. She calls me over as I put down my stuff, and here I am, defenseless because she's a cool teacher. I'm kind of siked she called me over, I bet it'll be great. Instead, I stand next to her desk as she's working on god knows what and waits until I actually speak and ask her what she wanted. She gives me back my exam and oh shit, I got like 103% on it. I'm all happy, thinking she was gonna tell me I did a really good job, but instead she tells me to turn to a page. It was the page I got a question wrong. She asks me why I got the question wrong, mind you, it was the only question I got wrong. And I can't answer her because what the hell are you supposed to say to that. She then stops what she's doing and looks me in the eyes and says. ""Everyone else in the class got that question right because I told you guys in class the answer, while we were going over everything. Obviously you're not paying attention in class. You're always fooling around."" Shit man. Back when I was like twelve and got in trouble, my whole face would get red and hot and I couldn't see clearly and I thought the teacher hated me and I would get so embarrassed and sad. I would be absolutely humiliated. I went back to my seat without saying anything like a dumbass. I was super quiet that day and I just did my work without talking to my friends.

I wish I would've told that b\*\*\*\* that I was so sorry I wasn't a stenographer, writing down every word she was saying and engraving that into my brain so I could regurgitate it on the exam day. I was so fucking sorry that I had the audacity to get a question wrong on my test and receive 103%. I guess I was just a stupid motherfucker and all I did in class was horse around. Yeah, I would've gone to the principle's office, you know I would've been loud about that shit. ""Oh yeah, I fucking forgot that I was in a classroom and my opinion has no place in it. I forgot this shit was a dictatorship and I'm not allowed to stand up for myself. Yeah, I'm gonna go to the principal's office to get expelled, I was way out of line.""  

Nobody's gonna read this so I'm just writing this down to fucking rant about this thing that just sprung into my memories and it's fucking pissing me off."
My ELA teacher gives a unit test after a no homework night.,"This happened back in January, we had known about the test for awhile (2 weeks) and we didn’t know that it was a no homework night on the night before the test. But she did! The test was on the 31st and the no homework night was on the 30th(my birthday coincidently) The week before the test people found out there was a no homework night before the test. Some people were happy other weren’t (me) for the next week she was bombarding is with emails and updates on our google classroom about making sure to study all week so we won’t have to on the no homework night. So on the day of the test some kids came to school wearing outfits related to the book we read (the outsiders) I didn’t. At the beginning of class she asks if anyone studied at least 6-12 people out of the 22 people in our class raised their hand. She became visibly upset and mumbled to herself for the rest of class for anyone wondering I got a 79% on the test. The highest anyone got the I heard from was 98%. But I asked my classmates what they thought about it and they said that they were having trouble sleeping the night before because of the no homework night and no studying rule.

That’s that this is my first post and I have a couple more stories I could share."
Roasting an incompetant teacher.,"This was a substitute teacher she was incompetant in every way. Didnt know anything about the subject, couldnt help anyone, spent half the fucking lesson checking the seating plan to make sure everyone was in the right place. I was putting 0.00000000000001% effort in due to this shitty substitute (also didnt know shit about a goat parable or something.) Towards the end of the lesson she approached me saying
 ""You havent done a single line""
Me: I did one and a half lines.
One friend: (Laughed slightly)
ST (Shitty Teacher): Ok why havent you done anything
Me: I dont get it
Friend: (Continues laugh)
ST: Why didnt you ask for help?
My brain: Time for shit to go down.
Me: (Raising voice) You spent 20 minutes checking the register you told (Other Student) that he should just try harder. So you couldnt help obviously.
Other Student: (Laughs)
ST: I think I should call behaviour team about this behaviour.
My Brain: FUCK!!!!
Me: Im going timeout. (Shows her my pass)
Sidenote: I had a pass to leave lesson so she couldnt do much.
ST: This is a toilet pass.
Me: (Looks back at pass) It says Time Out Pass right there. (Points)
ST: Why dont you stay and do your work instead.
Me: (Speakkng loudly) Nope! (Heads for door)
Friend and other student: (Laughs again.)
Other student: Yes (My Name) 
I leave and wait outside the lesson until it ends (3 more minutes)
Idk if this belongs here but ill share it anyway."
Pervert Teacher,"My 6th grade science teacher was a major pervert and was kicked off of being the girls basketball coach because he was looking at there boobs and butts. You could always see him staring down girls shirts and at there ass when they bent over. Since our school system had a rule that you can't fire a teacher you had to transfer them to another school, he stayed our teacher. He loved over sharing and decided to tell us how is wife showered. He had this god awful beard and told us he had it because his great great great great grandfather ""The first Norwegian in America"" had a really long one. He also said it was because his wife liked the way it felt... He also lied all the time, and was really self obsessed. To make it worse he taught us FLASH (Sex ed.)"
Had to vent my frustrations about my instructor.,"I've had lots of amazing teachers who really engage with students and make them feel involved with the class. But not my ethics instructor. He's an attorney who works part time as a teacher in our University to teach Media ethics. In my opinion, it's a waste of time going to his class. All he does is makes us read large sections of a book then have it reported on the next session. His homeworks are the same but it's to be submitted hand written on bond paper. At first I gave him the benefit of a doubt and thought ""Maybe he's busy and he has a lot to do"" I once caught him through a window in the teachers' lounge just playing mobile games. I dropped his subject due to conflicting schedules with my job as well as his crappy teaching methods.

2 years later, 2020. My University had to undergo a change in curriculum (it's a long story). Me, as an old student, had to stick to the old curriculum. I was required to complete the ethics class as a prerequisite for my major and I expected that I'd probably get a new instructor. Nope, it's the same person. I was put in a remedial class full of students he failed. It was a class of 18 people. It turns out, it's not the first time. He once received a complaint because he failed a class of 36 people. The school had to arrange a special summer class to basically repeat finals for this douchebag."

Reporting my bad teacher in a satisfying way.,"I have been playing the viola for over nine years. I know a bad player when I see one and my orchestra teacher is a perfect example. For those who know how to play a violin or viola, his bow was always sliding around and his right thumb was completely straight and sticking so far over his fingerboard. He would also support his violin entirely through his right hand instead of his jaw. Anyway, no more nerd talk. He would also be very late to class all the time. He would also not show up to class a lot without contacting the school to say that he wasn't coming. One time when he arrived 20 min late to class, he noticed I was giving him disgusted looks. He asked me what was wrong and I said ""Do you want the nice version ar the true version?"". He said he wanted the true version so he took me out into the hall. I told him my several issues I had with his class such as he he graded out of school concerts. He would announce afterschool concerts the day before and when we said we had other plans, he would give us a zero for the concert. I told him this concern among many others while he denied them. Finally I got to the juice.

Me: And also, you are late almost every class.

Teacher: That's not true.

Me: Yes you are

Teacher: No that is completely untrue.

Then I proceed to take out my phone and show him the attendance chart I had been taking of him for over a month. I did some calculations afterwards and it showed he was an average of five minutes late everyday (including the days he was on time) and he was late 75% of the time. He had also not shown up to class at all for 2 days.

Teacher: Okay fine.

Me: I'm sending this spreadsheet to the principal.

I did end up sending it to the principal. Here was the principal's reply:

 

Hi Levi,  
Thank you for sharing this. \[other principal\] will be following up with you if he hasn't done so already.   
Enjoy your evening.  
Sincerely,

He didn't end up getting fired or anything even though I clearly showed to them that he was not frequently attending class. Should I try harder to get him fired?"
Bitchy ass 2nd grade teacher,So when i was in elementary school each grade was spilt between 2 teachers (we were a tiny ass school) so i had gotten the bitchyer teacher of the 2. So i was in general pretty smart and a big smart ass so this teacher hated me from the beginning of the school year. Fast forward a couple of months and we just had a big batch of homework turned. This homework covered all subjects. Me being me i took the shortest possible route in all problems (I basically did everything in my head and gave just the answers). When Mrs. AH (the teacher) looked over my homework and asked why i didnt show my work I said “well i got the answer regardless didn’t i” (ik i sound entitled in this but it really was just sarcasm) she took my homework crumpled it up and threw it into the trash. My mind was going “hey wtf” but not really idk curse words. After chucking my paper in the trash she said “if i have no paper to grade youll just have to do it again. If this blows up ill say what i did in retaliation.
Awful 6 grade teacher yells at me till I cry for a minor mistake,"I really hated 5 and 6 grade because I had the worst math teacher in the world( in my opinion). If you missed one piece of work or didn't understand something she would yell at you and stare you down. For me, it got to the point where I was literally terrified of her. 

       In 6 grade, I had missed a day of school and got some extra make-up work. So I decided to do it. Now I didn't understand stand what I was doing, because I wasn't there, but I tried anyway. Boy was it a mistake turning it in. 
       I had done the work wrong, the work I did't understand because I wasn't there to learn it. She had yelled at me in front of the whole class. She continued till I broke down in tears and hid my head, and I could STILL hear her telling what I did was wrong and should magically understand it. She finally stopped, but she hinted it on for the rest of math and continued to glare at me. Man I hated her.

       Quick other story with her. I had missed a day if school because I was barfing and probably got some food poisoning or something. The next day my math teacher yells at me for not doing my homework, even though I wasn't even there to get it."
Thanks for ruining 6th grade!!,When I was in 6th grade my teacher hated me. And I know kids say that when they get bad grades but it’s true. Backstory I was always a quiet kind person but when my dad died I became less willing to talk in class. So now that you know that a tinny bit about me let’s get into it. I’ll call her mrs. Smith. Mrs Smith was my math and social study’s teacher. All we would do in math and 3 days out of the month would be social studies. She always said that she gave time to work on projects but yet it was when I had the go to system 44 so I was never in there. She would also blame me for not being good at math also I have terrible test anxiety because she always posts everyone’s score on the board! Edit she also dish that with map testing and my other teacher would give out prizes if you got good scores on tests which did not help with my test anxiety.
Awful gym teacher thinks I can run after ankle surgery,"Hey Reddit! First ever post. Long time lurker. 

I'm currently in nursing school and 21(f), so thankfully far removed from the high school in which this ""teacher"" worked.

I have many separate stories about her that I will try my best to condense into one, meta experience from hell.

She taught my freshman gym class. She was an overweight, African American woman that was all-around rude and unprofessional. (not implicating that this is because she's black-it just has context later.)

For starters, I had my first ankle reconstruction surgery that semester-had my second one my senior year-and was fully casted and crutched. Most days she would just have the students jog around the track while she sat in the corner. She was only friendly with the black students and would oftentimes allow them to talk loudly with her and not participate in the exercise while yelling at the other students who walked/didn't participate. Since I couldn't really even walk, I was given permission to sit in the corner and stretch/do my physical therapy exercises. I was a contortionist and dancer at the time, so I'd practice my flexibility. She said to her favorite group in the corner while I was in earshot ""If she can do all that crazy stretching, she can sure as hell run!"" Uh..no. I would like to see you run in a hard cast with an ankle/leg all stitched up.

We also had an autistic boy in our class who occasionally had ""tantrums"" that went away overtime, but he had an assistant with him still. One day during some classroom work (yes, we had days that we did classroom work in gym) he began getting upset. This inconsiderate witch proceeded to yell ""Get OUT I don't wanna HEAR IT"" at him as his aide escorted him out of the room, along with other vile things no professional teacher should say to an autistic student that I can't remember. 

Oh- and her social media. We found her instagram that was NOT private. She had posted videos of students during class to her page (which I am fairly sure is prohibited?) AND had posts depicting sexually graphic content (not of herself-thank god.)

I was assigned to have her the following year, and I immediately told my counselor I refused to be in her class. She's had multiple complaints against her and the counselor didn't hesitate to move me,  but I don't know how she has a job."
The picture explains itself. My teacher made this quiz btw,
In Tech school(or depicted as career classes),"First of all, I was watching Reddit Cubed on YouTube with the topic of “what happened in school that still pisses you off”

Just listening few of these, gotten me thinking about that one class I had and failed miserably.

So this happened in this small town of Virginia, year 2011-12. I was hoping class for specifically on architect but it was full and I was pushed into computer coding class. 

Just three people in the class, and a teacher. I thought it’s going to be easy since I enjoyed helping my parents at home with the computer but honestly it turned out wrong. First day, teacher hands me a very large paperback textbook. Telling me I have to read several chapters of five topics of Computer coding. He doesn’t tell anything else as I sat there with complete confusion. He doesn’t do much from there on while others are already on the assigned computers. 

I’ve read the chapters however I was a slow learner, I have a bad learning curve with words especially when I don’t understand the bigger words. Sure there was definitions but it wasn’t the same without the teacher. I asked first three times on what these meant. He explains then suddenly urgently leaves for a restroom. I think nothing of it as I continued my slow first day. About like three days involved with online tests of the topics, teacher said I needed to speed up so I can pick up the pace with the class. The questions are lot more difficult to muster and I can retake twice. First try was terrible, second try is at least I remembered my bad mistakes. Still failed the tests on the chapters. 

So then, I moved past the chapters and gotten my assigned computer. He brings up the subject of making a simple animation. Everyone rejoiced but I was like, “how am I supposed to do that” 

Technically he was supposed to teach that to me since I was late but I was busy cramming 67 chapters into my head. Wasn’t very pleasant that I was having mini meltdown panics. I wasn’t keeping up with everyone and I thought I was failing already. I had to watch a tutorial on YouTube or on Dailymotion online before I could submit my animation at the end of class, it was being graded. 

I panicked even more and simply did a ball drop with a small bounce.. he wasn’t impressed. That look he gave me, was added with a big sigh. I died on the inside. That also included of me being depressed in my sophomore year, I had the intentional fear of asking for help all my life. 

I failed that class nonetheless, and his words not mine, “look kid, maybe your future is mainly sticking at home. You can’t follow simply directions, I’ve tried my part” 

Still hating that in fact I never relearned in another class."
Bullshitting teacher," 

We have this teacher thats kind of sexist and favors students by how social they are( rn theres no skool cuz of covid19), but only subtly, so she never gets ratted on. But every single student, even her favorites know she does it.

I could rant about this teacher 4 so long but this story, this one broke the camel's back.

The whole class, all boys and girls, aren't doing work. We finished our work and she let us sit around and do nothing 4 the rest of her period. OK? Cool.

So the girls are playing w/ cards, chilling. The guys are talking about whatever. I'm sitting on my laptop, after I asked her if I can use it, and working on a project.

The girls start getting loud cuz clutch moment or something, fine, no one bats an eye. SUDDENLY, Ms. Sexism, who was explaining something to a student abruptly stops and shouts @ the guys. ""BOYS? HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I-"" ""It wasn't us"" one of them calmly cuts her off. She looks @ the girls and her face goes from furious pink to nothing. She says ""Oh, its just you guys.

THE WHOLE CLASS LOOKING @ THIS LADY LIKE SHE CRAZY. I'm like ""What's that supposed to mean?"" ""Um hey why are you using your laptop that's not allowed?""

HUH? She tells me to shut it off then goes back to explaining to the student, effectivley avoiding having to explain herself.

Story #2

We walk into class. She hands us tests. The other day we just agreed on the test for the day after tomorrow. Why did u give us the test early? Well, I think you're ready. Bullshit. After some arguing one of the smarter students in class, one of her favorites (Hey guess what? A girl!) said ""I think we should do it today"" I don't blame her 4 making that suggestion but thats only to her benefit, not the whole class.

Ms. Favoritism thinks otherwise. So I snapped.

""Is this how you teach? So her opinion is more important than the whole class? So you FAVOR her that much? How is this fair that's only to her advantage no one else wants the test today?""

Ms. Favoritism shuts up.

A student, a friend of my sister's, said ""Yep, that's her brother right there."" Cuz this lady tripped when she used to teach her too. My sis has waay more crazy stories. These aren't even the worst ones.

TL;DR: Sexist and favoritistic teacher shows her true colors and gets owned"
Teacher gives bad grades no matter how hard I try,"Hey everyone!

I am currently a senior in my last semester of nursing school. I am supposed to graduate with my BSN in May. Unfortunately for me, I was once again stuck with a teacher who I had last semester that gave me problems, and not much has changed this semester. It seems like no matter what I do, it’s never good enough. For each assignment I follow the rubric step by step, spend hours on it, and put a ton of effort only to receive a bad grade. This same instructor did the same thing last semester, but luckily I was able to bring my grade up which I fear I cannot do this time. The situation is different, it’s taught online now and there are not many assignments given therefore not many opportunities to bring up my grade. I currently have a 69% and I do not feel it’s deserved at all. Last semester when I had the same issues, I met and talked with her which did absolutely no good. I reached out to the chair of nursing last night and was told that she couldn’t do anything, that I would have to go through my instructor to be successful in the course. I just feel so defeated, l am not sure what to do when I feel like I can’t even talk to her. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Do you have any tips or advice? I have not come this far to fail now over a “teacher” who grades unfairly. I have never had an instructor like this and it’s awful."
my disrespectful teacher,"While in uni, we were all supposed to take an English class whether we had diplomas that proved our knowledge in English or not. The teacher was known to marks us low because according to her ''no need to have a good mark in English because at the other subjects (which were super difficult) you will all have good marks and therefore a good average ''. 

The class was super boring and she made it super difficult doing meaningless exercises(for example,  translating a document word to word and spending additional time to find 2 to 3 synonyms for every word or doing articles about Trump and his politics every day for a whole year which is super excessive and we didn't really discuss about his politics which would be of course interesting but just translating word to word ).

Anyway, this class had a lot of students of various nationalities and we were all of various levels in English from people that barely speak any English to people that were basically fluent. Nevertheless, her standards were high. At this class, we had a guy of African origins that was really bad at English he could even pronounce a word correctly. He wasn't even going to class a lot. 

One of the rare cases that he actually went, the teacher was trying to 'help' him by pressuring him to  read the article and trying to translate it. It actually took him 10 minutes just to read the first two sentences and pronouncing terribly. He was really uncomfortable and was trying to avoid her but she kept pressuring him to continue.Then one  fellow student (let s call her Lisa) stood up for him and told her to not pressure him anymore and that this is humiliating for him. Teacher got shocked and tried to justify that she only tried to help him because he got a really bad note at the exam. Lisa and teacher got into a debate and the guy didn't say anything and just stood up and left and we never saw him again... 

Lisa tried to find support from the other students but she said that no one supported her(she sent a message on Facebook to the page of the university but I didn't see anything)  so she went alone and talked about this issue to the head of faculty. Teacher got a warning and in the end Lisa didn't pass the exam because , since this is her second master, no need to pass English after all. 

Also, the day of the exams we were all astonished that the exercises were easy comparing to last year's exam and the grades were fairly good for most of the students I talked to. I guess Lisa helped us in the end but I don't know if her actions were a bit excessive. What do you think?

 (Btw, Students were scared to react because they wanted to pass the class.)"
Made a student just sit there and choke.,"Hi this is my first post in the sub reddit. So there is this kid, and she has a studder and has phlegm always gets into her mouth. in this post we will call her Sarah. Now onto the story

Teacher: T

So suddenly, Sarah gets the phlegm in her mouth.
She gets up, and T says ""Sit down! Why are you up?""
She points to her mouth clearly showing snot in there, trying to talk with her mouth half full with snot along with the stutter.
T shouts ""Sit down! You cant explain why you're up, si sit down!""
Sarah heads back to her seat.
Right as she sat down, she almost like threw up all the snot, and guess what the teacher did?
T baraded Sarah to get out.
She did, tears filling up in her eyes, and when she left she said ""Did she do that on purpose?""
She has the audacity to ask when she threw up to ask if it was if it was on purpose.
And she gets paid 2nd highest in the state for this bs.
Tl;dr Girl tries to get to trash can to throw up, gets yelled at to go back to her seat, throws up on table."
My english teacher didn't want to talk to me,"This was in Freshman Year of high school, when I was a very uptight and nervous student. I always made sure to talk to my teachers in case anything went wrong, like a missing assignment, or something I needed help with. 4th period, my last period, I had english 9. This teacher was one who had an adoration to people who were popular, and fortunately for me, my class was full of them, people who couldn't stop throwing things, screaming, and acting like the regular idiot. I could ignore them, but the biggest imbecile in the class was probably the teacher. Let's say I had a missing assignment, and I needed to get it turned in. I walked to the teacher BEFORE class started, and I asked her if I could turn in the assignment. She ignored me for my whole statement, and then says ""good morning"". This is in 4th period, mind you. This was 1:30 pm. I thought she had mis-heard me, so I repeated my question. In the middle, she would say ""good morning, sit down and let me start class"". I obliged, and as soon as I sat down, she started looking at her phone. I looked at the time, and there was still 5 minutes for class to begin. Ok, I thought, maybe at the end of class. As soon as class ended, she left with her gaggle of teachers, and soon, I had a pile up of missing assignments. And they stayed missing. Because of this teacher's wonderful attitude. I love equality."
Teacher embarrassing me infront of the whole class,"My 2nd grade literature teacher was one old teacher, and a very mean teacher. One time, I was kinda good in computers since my brother had teached me. So I asked her, ""Do I put it in all caps"" And then she laughs, and she for some reason, gets the class to laugh at me. Thank god I've gotten better in literature, that I can probably get revenge by laughing at one of her mistakes."
Things You Just DON'T DO,"Hey my name is Jinxx and boy oh boy have I got a story for you.

It's 9th grade and I have English class. I love English because of writing and plays but my god do I hate terrible teachers. Let's just call her Mrs.Torture (MT)

So a bit of context:

We were studying mythical gods of Greece. I'm thrilled. Not only because my sister is in my group but because I've always been interested in it. 

On to the story.

We decided to record the presentation on my phone. 
It took a few weeks but when we had finished my phone oddly began to glitch and break down so I couldn't get to the videos. However instead of being understanding and patient MT decided to get angry with me. (Note: I have TERRIBLE anxiety)

MT: Well why didn't you share it with another student?

Me: I didn't think of it because this wasn't supposed to happen.

MT: Maybe you should just be more responsible!

Me: I can only do my best..

MT: Your best clearly isn't good enough.

(At this comment I'm ready to cry. The project is now a bit over due and I was in a very bad headspace. Thankfully My Sister (MS) was there. We're passing looks throughout)

MS: Well like he said this wasn't planned or meant to happen. We have the work done and we didn't think to share it. 

(They talk back and forth. My mind is a little foggy at this)

It lasts for 20 minutes and she really said hurtful things about me not being good enough and told me how I failed the group.
At this point tears are streaming down my face rapidly and I can't even move. MS and the rest of the group needed one final video and I was to be the one taking it meaning I felt very pressured. I walk away from the group and hide around the corner softly sobbing into my knees while MS was doing her best to comfort me by rubbing my back and hugging me.

 It lasted into my final period where I still felt sad but wasn't crying. 

In drama I needed to print something but for 10 minutes it just was not working so this lead to more anxiety about failing the group. The group walks in and I'm shaking and scared. It gets to the point I breakdown in front of them. They all try to make me feel better and say to take a walk so I do.

A few days later MT made the excuse that ""she had to apply pressure so I would get it done."" MS however is right there with my reasoning as I again cry. 

MS: Jinxx has anxiety and clearly when you applied pressure he got worse.

MT: Its over with now so he should be fine.

Please note she (MT) went on like that for a while and I had been bullied by teachers and students alike in my past for most of my life. Applying pressure does NOT help and you don't tell students they ""failed the group""

TL/DR: Teachers never should make a stupid excuse for making a student with anxiety cry uncontrollably. Don't teach if you're just going to do this to a student."
English teacher should listen to her own lesson.,"My English teacher told us to pick a song that symbolizes the holocaust. She told us to make sure the song didn’t say the f word or the n word. Her reasoning for this was because it could be a trigger word for someone and you might not know it. Although she talks highly of not censoring anything. A few weeks before that lesson she said the n word in class. Thought It was kinda ironic. 

Tl;dr: English teacher said something she told us not to say."
Drama With My Drama Teacher,"So in my Sophmore year of Highschool (grade 10 for all you non-Americans) I had this boyfriend, and we were in drama together.  At first it was fine, but over time he became more and more (sexually) abusive towards me (and the other girls he cheated on me with.  Not that he considered it cheating, bc he never had sex with them but whatever).  I broke up with him after about a month or two of “officially” dating (we had been unofficially dating for about a year before this), and I thought it’d be fine.  He ignored me in class and didn’t hang out with my friends anymore, which was more than fine with me.  I missed school for one (1!) day bc of my medical issues, and HE volunteered me to be in a group with him for a group performance.  To say I was mad would be an understatement.  I was FURIOUS.  I’ll admit I wasn’t very nice to him, but he was sexually harassing the other girl in our group and not actually doing any work so I figured it was only fair.  We got into a pretty major fight about a week after the group projects started.  We were screaming at each other.  Here’s where the bad teacher comes in.  Our group mates had gotten tired of our constant fighting and told her.  She called us into our office and gave us the typical lecture about leaving our problems at the door of the theater.  My ex was pissed that he was in trouble because of me.  He told her that it was impossible for him to leave his problems at the door, because I was bullying him and making him suicidal.  Instead of reporting that he was suicidal, she told him to get out and turned on me and started SCREAMING about how I was “ruining this poor boy’s life.” I told her how he treated me, and she called me a bitch for “lying about [ex bf], he’s the nicest boy I’ve ever met.”  She told me that she wasn’t going to report me, but was instead going to fail me on the project.  I told my parents and they were MAD (not bc they believed me about the abuse, bc they didn’t, but because I had written almost the whole script for our group project and deserved credit).  My dad called her and told her they were going to report her.  My teacher totally backtracked and said that she totally understood my anger, and “would have never let ex bf and I in a group together if she knew we had been in a relationship” (which was total bs bc she had TOLD US when we were dating that she thought we were a cute couple).  This isn’t the only terrible thing this teacher did (a certain situation where she shoved a student having a panic attack and called her a coward comes to mind) but she had tenure and we couldn’t get her fired.  

TLDR; I got in a fight with my abusive ex.  He told teacher that I was making him suicidal.  Teacher took his side and called me a bitch.  Dad calls her and she lies and said she’d never have let us work together if she knew we had romantic history.  Gets off scott-free."
Other experiences with my Crazy Stubborn Foods Teacher,"Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/badteachers/comments/cawj3q/my_rude_home_ec_teacher/

More things with my Crazy Stubborn Foods Teacher.
Cast
Me: High school Panda Hat Girl
CSFT: Crazy Stubborn Foods Teacher

1) One day CSFT went on a rant about how farmers are the reason there are environment problems and how they need to stop using gas and to just pick all there products by hand. Her reasoning? She can pick her own vegetables so the farmers can too.

I, having grown up in a small town with most of my one side of my family being farmers knew there was a big difference between CSFT picking vegetables in her tiny garden in the big city and farmers HUGE ASS FIELDS OF CORN AND WHEAT.

So I showed her pictures of those fields and explained the difference but she kept saying ""No."", ""You're wrong"" and ""those are photoshopped""

2) I forget exactly how this came up but I do remember her telling the class that when you stir iced tea powder into water, it doesn't dissolve and just is swirling around in the water and that of you left it out long enough the powder would seperate completely again and you could reuse it.

3) she HATED every food network chef ever. She would put on videos of them and say they didn't know what they were doing. She would constantly say ""That's cooked too much""

No CSFT that's just what chicken looks like when it's not cooked in the FREAKING MICROWAVE!!

4) she was 100% a germaphob. Everytime we used the kitchens we had to clean EVERYTHING!! even if we didn't use it while cooking. EVERYTHING WAS CONTAMINATIONED!!"
"20 years ago, I had a experience with a teacher that could have ruined my entire education.","A teacher told me I had fought with another kid, broken a cassette player and had anger issues. So she sent me to the counselor’s office and I had to do anger management classes for weeks. 

I was 7, didn’t understand why I was getting in trouble for crimes I didn’t commit, and eventually they found out that teacher was jealous of my dad who taught the same grade at the same school and was leaps and bounds more popular with parents and students.

She was giving me bad reports and fabricating my issues to make my dad look bad....

So he transferred me to another school without permission (which is like, bad teacher etiquette.)

At the new school I was removed from “special ed” and placed in all the highest level reading and math class groups because apparently she was lying about me being educationally delayed too."
Teacher Didn't Stop Bullying then Bragged About it After School,"I was bullied really badly in school. But the most annoying thing that makes my blood boil with rage is learning that after a horrible experience in the classroom with a group of bullies I was informed that the teacher of said classroom (who mind you didn't even say or do anything until my best friend intervened) talked about it afterwards at the after school Drama Club or whatever and practically bragged about not doing anything. 
I didn't know about this until a year after the incident but it makes me so angry knowing that this woman, a teacher, couldn't be bothered with to keep the kids surrounding me and harassing me and making me cry, thought it would be okay to talk about it and proudly state how she did nothing to stop it. But I guess that's why they called it the Drama Club.

Fun Fact: I saw her a couple of times after leaving middle school and would say hello to her to be polite and she would look directly at me and ignore me. 

Another Fun Fact: She also had an annoying little habit of harassing the heck out of my brother by claiming he didn't have his shirt tucked in and such. The vice principal at the time was called over by her as she demanded he ""tell this boy to tuck in his shirt"" to which the VP replied ""his shirt is tucked in"" and my brother walked away.

This woman shouldn't be working in the school system if she's just going to be rude and allow children to be bullied and go out of her way to harass students herself. 

(I originally posted this on my Facebook and my aunt, who works in the school system saw this post and REPORTED this teacher. She said even though this incident was close to ten years ago she should face the consequences of allowing bullying and then talking about it as though it was some sort of trophy. My aunt rocks ❤️)"
Terrible Spanish Teacher,"A few stories from 6-7th grade courtesy of my Spanish teacher 

1) She once called all of us retards because we didn’t understand what she was teaching. She grew up in Venezuela speaking both Spanish and English, so she couldn’t understand why it was so hard because she figured it was easy to learn.

2) She bragged about how her dad bought her a new Jeep, the new iPhone X (the day it came out), and the new AirPods (the day they came out). She also bragged about seeing Avenger Endgame and threatened to spoil the entire movie for us.

3) She would FaceTime her friends in class with her AirPods in. She would give us busywork and just talk to them. Even during tests and quizzes.

4) She obviously had favorites, but she wasn’t secretive about them at all. She would directly tell us just to make the rest of us feel bad.

5) She locked this boy in my class in her room with her and bribed him to tell her his crush (this was after she made all of us leave the room).

6) She would tell us 11 year olds about how much she hated her husband on a regular basis (she got a divorce a year later)

7) She would have us watch movies instead of work at least 3 times a month. And not even in Spanish. I basically memorized Zootopia and Coco (which I’m pretty sure she had us watch on an illegal website but that’s non of my business)

8) She would scream at us, and she would openly admit it to the parents. It could be for absolutely no reason at all and she would just start yelling at us (like how I mentioned that she called us retards, that was in a screaming fit)

9) She gave us tests over stuff we had never even learned. One specific time, we spent no time even near the chapter that she gave us a test over, and 80% of us failed. The smartest girl in our grade was crying because she didn’t even know anything on it, and she usually starts studying for sections we haven’t even covered weeks in advance.

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk!"
I don't know what to title this,"Alright, this was a few weeks ago in my Language arts class where I can tell you, tea was being spilled. Basically there's a girl that goes to my school named Roweyn, and Roweyn is one of the 2 top students in our grade with a solid 4.0 GPA.  Some kids were talking shit about her by saying she was a teacher's pet and shit (she kinda was though) she always talked to the teachers and shit like ""Hey Susan, I saw your daughter's dance recital on Facebook!"" You know, shit like that. 


The teacher heard this, got up from her desk, and started screaming. Like this bitch was FURIOUS. And she said some shit which you probably shouldn't say to people who you have everyday for most of the year. 

And here are some of her choice quotes
""Roweyn is a better student then all of you!""
""She will be more successful than all of you!""

I'm not defending shit talking Roweyn, but the way she handled it was unprofessional and innapropriate. Like you can't you say that shit to a classroom!"
the sexist teachers who lives down the street,"hey y’all, first post here so be nice 😅 

little backstory: i’m 16 and female, meaning i get lots of sexist and disgusting remarks thrown at me, especially in school. this happened 3 years in 8th grade, i’m now in the last months of 10th grade. on with the story. 

part one:  on the first day of grade 8 i was already nervous cause i had a fresh buzz cut and dressed really masculine (i was going through a “figuring myself out” phase) each grade is split into 3 clusters or groups. two of the clusters science teacher were notoriously known for being creepy and sexist to their students, but no solid evidence had ever come up. i knew i was in for it since i was masculine presenting girl who had a sexist creepy science teacher. Let’s call him Mr. B. The other creepy teacher was in the room next to us in the other cluster, we’ll call him Mr. R.  The first day of class was bad, he was weird, talked about himself in the third person, and made tests and worksheets purposely difficult since “he knew he would be able to pass, we should too”. it was bullshit. 

part two: about halfway through the year i tried out for a festival drama production (i got the lead!!) and Mr. R was in charge of props with children helping him even though he was SUPER PERVY!! we’re 13-14 and he’s 50+ so when i was getting fitted for my costume, which was a big sweatshirt, jeans and converse, he was kinda creepy and watching from the back of the room while i got my costume and he did props. that was my only real creepy encounter with him other than casual hello’s on halloween when we’d go to his house or i’d see him outside school or his house. i forgot to mention this man lived diagonally across the street from me. 

part three: Now for Mr. B. he was a jerk all the time, only called on guys for easy questions and made girls embarrass themselves with really difficult questions and stuff we had no idea about. one day he was talking in third person (like he always does) and explains about how something is always consistent or never changes, idk i wasn’t listening. he then says “it’s like how women are always awful drivers.” now THIS caught my attention, along with every woman in the room. our heads whipped around in anger and he knew he was in deep shit. he even said how he knew he was in trouble now. some people shook it off, although i didn’t and felt really offended. he was also really creepy and talked about how women’s bodies were usually bigger than men’s since “sports wasn’t our thing” although everyone in the room including girls did some sort of sport at the time. i didn’t, but chose not to say anything. now he lived up the street from me, so i’m stuck in between these gross men. 

that’s all from me. i have a really bad algebra teacher this year so tell me if you want to hear about her too!"
Oh my friends 4th grade,"This story starts in 4th grade mind you a cuss word for a student would give you a suspension yes are school rules were dumb that’s a story for another day this is my crappy teacher mrs m not her real name and her last name doesn’t start with m

Alright so this teacher Is honestly the worst person I have ever had as an educator
She lied to my parents. I did a whole paragraph I think it was westward expansion and said I only wrote “3 words” that’s not the worst  so remember that cussing rule she said 3 cuss words to me and yelled “YOU BASTARD” at another student .and said my essay was shit and it was crap and my parents didn’t believe me or the principal it was until then half of are class said she cussed  and talked to us separately then she got fired he told us how she got fired Remember this teacher lies and I gotta say she smelled like tobacco her teeth looked like she chewed tobacco for 30 years and the principal found cigarettes in her drawer then she told us “im retiring” no no no you got fired then on the last day we got report cards SHE MIXED THEM ALL UP she gave us an f u before she left turns out I actually passed so that’s great oh yeah I found out last year her husband divorced her when she got fired because he doesn’t like cussing in front of kids and many times he had to help her with not cussing and yes she has anger problems mind you she had a vendetta against me she would target me I go to get a pencil “SIT DOWN” she did her best to embarrass me I did get by with petty revenges here and there like messing up my desk on purpose but that backfired and made me stay back so I didn’t go to gym so a. inschoolsuspension I guess. bad teachers right"
My Professor Stole my Donuts While I was Taking his Exam,"After maintaining a perfect 4.0 GPA throughout college, I was in my last semester taking biology. That was when I got the professor from Hell (who also ironically is a preacher). He took pride in kids failing as well as the fact that no body had ever gotten an A in his class. After preparing hard for our first exam and studying flashcards, quizlet, tutoring, study group, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS I was ready for the exam! However, I ended up getting a freaking D on the exam! After much talk about me dropping his class, he convinced me to stay saying that everyone does bad on the first exam. By the time I realized he was full of shit, I could no longer get a refund and had to stick it out. Well, in order to mourn the loss of my perfect GPA and chance at the ivy leagues, scholarships, life of happiness, etc. I bought some donuts with the last of the money college had not yet ripped away from me. Well, my exam was in the lab where no food was allowed due to chemicals, so I placed my donuts on the table outside of my classroom with a thick layer of paper towels covering the box so that nobody would mess with them. I finally finished the awful exam, and was looking forward to splurging and enjoying my donuts while grieving my GPA.... To find, my professor, eating my fucking donuts, with the rest of the class. He smiles at me and says: ""Since you were the last to finish, I saved you half of a donut. If you had finished sooner then you would have gotten a whole one, but there was not enough for everyone."" He was acting as if HE had the heart to buy the class donuts!!! He was feeding them mine! As I sadly, wanting to cry, picked up the last half of my donut to run out the door with he shouted: ""Since it is only half, it will only take 10 minutes off of your life instead of 20!"" I did not say a word to this awful man about what he had done to me, but I did say back to him: ""Your class has taken much more time off of my lifespan than the whole box would have."" I then told my friend about the ordeal, and he bought me donuts out of pity. Moral of the story: Do not trust a professor that victory dances when the class average is a 50, and lock up your donuts if you still have money after paying for his class."
Our teacher butt hurt because we dont care about freshman grades. 😂 we aint sorry that you talk crap about us behind our backs. we say it in front of you.,
My textiles teacher is trying to fail me because I’m a male,"Okay so I’ll get started by saying that I am posting for the first time, but really wanted to just get this out in the open. 

So currently I am the only male student in the only textiles class in our year, and I will be honest at the begging of the year I was not great at the subject (I only chose it because I had a crush on one of the girls and I was great at the theory of it). But as time progressed I began to get better developing my portfolio with personal research and tons of information from the support of my year 10 teacher. By the end of the year I had everything up to date and was exceeding the expectations that my previous years had set forth for me.

But then suddenly we got a new teacher. Instead of having detailed and understandable explanations of our coursework we suddenly had short 10 second talks at the beginning of how we where all behind and what we need to do. The stress of this new teacher led to two people being in tears and many complaints to our headteacher. 

Now ordinarily I would have just ignored this and got on with my life, but this teacher seemed to want me to fail. So at one point I was behind on my work and had been catching up with my work but After having to Email all the work over , individually mind you, I found that she had left one of the crucial prices of work unprinted. Now I was okay with that maybe it was a little mistake but I asked her about it and she said that It hadn’t reached her. So I re sent the email assuming she would have received it and printed it.

Boy was I wrong.

After being pestered by her over and over about it I re emailed it for a third time, only to have to email it another two times to no avail. As of me making this there is no update on it and I’m still yet to have any other response on it.

In addition to that I was behind on my designs so I caught up on it and handed it in to her, verbally stating it to her and asking for her to sign a piece of paper to prove I did hand it in (yes I know very obnoxious but I really needed the proof for my parents who wanted to make sure she was receiving it) so I thought all was well until suddenly my parents get emailed by her.

She states that I am “massively behind” and “requires a drastic improvement in attitude to succeed” and states that due to my missing work I had to attend two  6 hour sessions during my half term time. Monday the 17th and Tuesday the 18th February. At this point I was already ahead of most people in my practical work and was only missing my final design but when our previous teacher came in to check up on progress she said to her that I was far behind all the girls and that I would fail.

Despite this after I had a brief conversation with my previous teacher she told me that she had seen my work and believed that (when coupled with my mock results) I would be able to pass with ease.

Now after this my new textiles teacher has been isolating me from the rest of the class and has told some of them that they shouldn’t help me, in addition to this they have begun to try and damage my coursework to set me back, like altering the concentration of my dye in the vat I’m using, and by telling me I can’t do certain things, which means I now have to re- start my final design.


Super sorry for sounding whiny but I’m really just fed up with her and wanted to get it off my chest.

Have a great day guys

OverbossSouthern


Edit: my parents know what is going on but feel that we have very little evidence of it happening. In addition to this our headteacher is rather busy currently due to him leaving after many years.

Okay so I’m the past 2 days I had a big development where my food technology teacher (she’s really nice and honestly cares about her students and just wants to allow us to learn in a way we do best) comes up to me in class and tells me that she had been approached by my textiles teacher about removing me from my food classes and putting me into textiles instead. Now we only just finished our coursework and we were all looking forward to having relaxed revision lessons, but instead now I’m being summoned to do textiles. Now it is my decision but currently I’m at the point where I feel that if I do the sessions, I’ll have more of a chance about getting to prove her wrong, but I also don’t want her to take any credit for the work I’m putting in so I’m not really sure.

Thank you all for the support, I’ll keep you guy’s updated :)."
13 years ago i had a teacher who told me the Hopi is not real,"When i was still in school I had a teacher who told us to research a Native american tribe. I choose the Hopi for they seemed interesting. 

She told me I had to pic a real one. When I tried to argue that They were real. And showed her a list of nations on the American Bureau of Indian Affairs she informed me it was "" communist propaganda"" and had me kicked out of class for "" disrupting class"" she hated when anyone questioned her knowledge.

She was good at teaching some things. But that was very silly of her.
I apologize if my grammar is bad, as this is not my native language.

I am still baffled she claimed the hopi was not a real people
Edit: i made this when quite tired. 8 years ago. My bad"
SLD classes made me drop out.,"Begining in 3rd grade they thought it was a good idea to put me in a Specific Learning Disability (SLD) class to ""help"" me due to finishing my work slowly.
SLD classes are supposed to exist to have the teacher or aid help their students to better understand the lessons to get them up to speed.

However, it seems like the leingth of time it took to do the work was the only deciding factor in putting kids in these classes, because of this 90% of the kids in the classes where trouble makers and only in these classes because they were too busy being little a******s instead of doing their schoolwork.
As a result, only one or two kids in these classes actually needed to be there and needed help but the teachers were too busy having to deal with the trouble students.

One class I had a horrible ""teacher"" in 4th grade (I think) who called me white trash for pokeing a hole into my sweater with a pen (I was a kid) and mouthed off to my mom one time that ""I was taking to place of another child in her class"" or some such bs. We will call her Mrs. k

One time Mrs. K cut my math worksheet down to 25% of the problems. I still needed help understanding the mechanics of the problems and the teacher instead of atempting to lend a hand decided I was choosing to not do the work and was just wasting everyone's time, when in actuality I just needwd somwone to take the time and explane it to me.

One day I guess she had enough of my ""not willing to do the work"" along with the school's counselor that I should have my lunch withheld untill I finished the math sheet. All the while my lunch was sitting there getting cold.

This teacher and counselor also wanted to gaslight me any time I complained that a bully in my class was constantly messing with me durring class. Telling me to ""stop blaming others for my failings"" never seeing what anyone else did to me but only seeing when I tried to defend myself or retaliate. This also happened with literally every teacher I had ever since I was put into SLD classes in 3rd grade.

This lead me want to try to be homeschooled when finished with elementary school. But my mom was working and she couldn't be home to be my teacher, and because I already had issues focussing, I mostly just watched tv.
I did try to attend middle school, but I was met with the same SLD class and another ""teacher"" that always believed any other student above me any time I was picked on/bullied and even when students outright lied about me.

After a while I just left school. Didn't finish middle school or even attend high school.

I honestly hope SLD classes aren't like this anymore and kids that actually need help will get the help they need."
Creepy Teacher,
Finishing assignment,"When I was in First grade I went to a Catholic school. They’re surprisingly strict and anger often. Once, we’re doing Bible studies but I couldn’t finish because it was already time for lunch. So my teacher pulled me out of class WITHOUT my lunch and made me finish it, lunch was about 30 minutes and my teacher made me spend 20 minutes of it hungry and bored. When I was done with it though my teacher said with the most sarcastic voice “Well, I hope you get to finish your lunch.” When I told this to my mom, my teacher said “He’s lying.” But I got my revenge and left the school the grade after."
My Dads teacher in 2nd grade made fun of him and encouraged students to it to,"Back round: so i was at my grandmas a few days ago and i was complaining about school and she told me this story to tell me how the d nothing for bad teachers

The people: D (dad duh) gm (grand ma) Bt ( bad teacher) s (other students) bg (box cutter girl) alright lets go to the story

sorry if i missed any details my grand ma is old  and she told me like 3 months ago any questions ask me"
I wasn't allowed to go to the bathroom and got called a liar for telling my parents.,"I am a thirteen year old female. Slightly in question about my gender and maybe even going to make the switch. Very uncomfortable when it comes to ""female puberty"" related stuff.

I have slight problems with making friends and don't like public settings.

Okay, now that that's sorted out, this is happening \*right now.\* I tried to tone down the female body talk for the males that may read this.

I was tested for a clotting disorder that would effect the flow of my menstrual cycle. Came back negative, but not to far off from being positive.

I often have to get up in the middle of class to deal with any leaks.

So, a couple weeks ago, I asked my English teacher, Mrs. R if I could go to the bathroom to take care of business . She said no and I ended up leaking onto my pants.

I ask the next day, this time telling her on my situation. She yet again says no and I leak once again.

After that, I told my mother and my mom, being the strong person she is, sent a polite email explaining my problems and politely asking to let me go.

Mrs. R (more like Mrs. Retard) replies with the \*BITCHIEST email EVER,\* in which she called me a liar and talked about how she ""told me I could go."" Even if she did say yes, I wouldn't have been able to go with no hall pass, which I needed her to sign. (Spoiler alert, she wouldn't sign it)

The next day we had a huge exam ad as I handed her the booklet and said goodbye, she replied with a wince and grunt.

\*Time skip to today.\* I came in and prepared my work that had to be handed in. One of the delinquents of the class comes in and starts goofing off.

She calls administration to remove him and after a few minutes, a lady from the office came to the door in order to remove him.

He mutters something under his breath.

Mrs. Retard- I mean R proceeds to scream ""SHUT UP AND GET OUT OF MY CLASS!""

And hour later in my next class, I was called to the assistant principal's office.

My anxiety soon peaked, and I was not comfortable with the whispering about my reason for being called up.

""Why is Grace getting called?""

""Oooh I think it's because she called Mika a f\_gg\_t""

""She's to well behaved to be in trouble""

I soon arrive in Mrs. Y's office.

She assures me that I am not in trouble and asks for my eyewitness account of the event.

I give her what I observed and leave.

My friend Tristan is sitting in the chair filling out the report, and apparently was writing down every pointless thing we were punished or scolded for in her class.

Rumor has it she might get fired.

And I have learned that both Karma AND Mrs. R, are bitches.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Update: Mrs. Retard wasn't fired. 

My mum told me to give Mrs. R a box of chocolates on Valentine's day, which we do for all the teachers.

I made sure to spit on it beforehand."
What can I do about my situation with this teacher?,"Hi, I just found this sub and I just wanted to hear some advice, if possible and you please, because I'm pretty worried and unsure about what to do.

The thing is, the U just started, the class started, he said the rules of his class and stated: ""You can't enter the class after me..."" and ""You can only have 2 abscences..."", otherwise you had failed the course. He grouped us by 6/7 members to expose themes for the class.

I didn't go to the next 2 classes because of me falling asleep.

And the next class, I did assist, but he didn't like it, and started saying that I had failed the course already and I should go to another class (of same subject), or just get signed out of the course (but I only could take it again next semester).

A classmate, which I think noticed I assisted to at least one class, told him that he said we had rights to have 2 abscences; he answered I had 3 abscences. At the end of the class he said he didn't want to see me the next class (tomorrow).

&#x200B;

My team then did the presentation document, but didn't take the sketch I just gave them a day before that to do it.

So I'm gonna ask the leader if I can still be part of the team and tweak the document for better; depending on his response I'm gonna go tomorrow, but I'm just don't wanna leave this try die and repeat the course later.

&#x200B;

I talked to my tutor, and she said I should leave a complain, and that it's too late to change the course. But I didn't ask about getting signed out nor leave the complain. My classmate later told me that I should still try going because of the two and not three abscences.

&#x200B;

English is not my first language, I'm very sorry if I'm not being clear enough or my spelling mistakes inconfort you.

It's my first class (9:00 am) and I take the bus to go to school (takes me around 40 minutes); both times I woke up around 9:15.

The teacher talks about being very humble; he's very authoritarian, and mean (except to my female classmates), and didn't let some classmates enter the class when they had photo evidences of a traffic accident that delayed them."
The Married Duo Of Social Studies,"So my high school has a married couple that both teach social studies. One of them teaches French Immersion and the other taught English.... originally. We’ll call them Mr. L and Mrs. L. Mrs L taught French social studies. Her husband taught English.

At the beginning of last year, Mrs. L took a huge tumble in the cafeteria in October and ended up with a concussion. This is where I’ll grant some leniency; Her husband was only going to teach one class that whole semester. English social studies. When his wife left, though, he took on all of her classes. In French. A language that he... spoke... sure... but was NOT trained to teach in.

At first we’d heard she would come back for semester 2, then we heard she wouldn’t come back for the rest of the year. So I was stuck with Mr. L for the second semester.

This guy had ALL the trademarks of a bad teacher. For one, he taught a freshman social studies class like a university lecture course. Weeks of class time he would spend talking on and on in his chair. No engagement, there was no discussion, no notes to take, and to make matters worse, his French speaking voice was monotonous and exhausting to listen to. At any given time half the class would be asleep.

This man also didn’t. Mark. Anything. Not that he lost stuff (which he did) he just didn’t mark anything. Learned from an uncle that taught at my school over christmas that one year, he only marked two things. By the end of the semester, the ENTIRE class was failing. I knew most of the people in my 25 person class. Not a single person I talked to was above a 60% pass mark.

Including myself, I had a 56. But hey, the exam was coming up. We could do this, you guys. It was worth 20%. 4 hour Study groups were organized. A few particularly smart kids made an entire packet of shit to study. Every subject he prattled on about.

Imagine our surprise when on report card day, people jumped from the 30s to the 70s, the 40s to the 80s, and me, with a 56, jumped to a 92. 
He put everyone’s exam on a CRAZY curve because he knew admin would ask questions if all 5 of his classes failed.

Now let’s get on to Mrs L, now, I will say, I do not/have not had her. So this is all hearsay. But what I do know for sure happened, is I had an aunt that taught their middle school aged son social studies at a different school. He got a bad grade on a test, and Mrs. L stormed into her room, and demanded she have the test so she could “remark it correctly”. No. Joke.

This year, it appears that Mr. L has gone on a sabbatical to study geology in Europe... good riddance.
But it’s *tearing* their marriage apart.

How do we know?
Mrs. L (Ms L?) has been showing her classes pictures of them on their wedding day about 15 years ago proclaiming; “this is the Mr. L I married!!!!” And when people would ask why he wasn’t teaching this year, she would say “he’s in Europe... studying ROCKS.” With the most disdainful voice.

In short, this couple is uh.... an interesting two."
My pushover teacher,"Hey, I'm a first time poster, I hope you enjoy my story!

So when I was in grade 11 (2 years ago) I had this math teacher that was a huge pushover. He wouldn't really do much except for write an equation on the board, show us how to solve this specific equation, then let us do homework. I wasnt getting good grades so I decided to go in for lunch one day for help. I went in and was working on my homework when he was hanging around. I eventually finished and I asked if he could look over my questions to see if I did something wrong. Instead if beling like ""sure, I'm a teacher, this is my job"" he straight up just said, ""oh, the answers are on google classroom"". I just got up and left. If I got a bad mark on my test it's his fault. I did my test and ended up getting a 60 on it. He pulled me aside after class and it went something like this:

Teacher: OP, Can I talk to you for a second?

Me: Yeah, sure

Teacher: I was marking your test the other day and I think you should start trying harder. 

Me: well I came in for help at lunch and all you did was tell me to look at the google classroom. 

I started walking out because I was done dealing with stupid things like this. What's the point in having your classroom open at lunch if you're only gonna tell students to do things they can do from home?

As I was walking out, he said ""Well- you should've tried again!"" I didnt even respond and walked out to my next class.

This wasnt even the worst of it.

There were these 2 kids, let's call them Ben and Clyde.

So ben and clyde liked to interrupt the class. A lot.  And our teacher didnt do much about it. One of their favorite things to do is to grab paper towels, go to the washroom, soak them into little balls, take them back, and throw them at the ceiling/teacher, and they would stick wherever they threw them. One day, they were doing exactly this, and then, ben threw one at clyde. Clyde had a super big ego, and well, it went down hill. I dont remember everything but I'll do my best to re create it in my head. I'm also gonna be replacing many naughty words with other ones.

Clyde: yo, why would you throw one at me?

Ben: cuz it's funny that's why

Clyde: it's not funny!

Ben: man it's just a wet towel would you calm down, you wussy

Clyde: dont call me that, and dont throw trash at me!

Ben: would you calm down ya wussy?

Clyde: call me that one more time

Ben: you wussy.

Clyde immediately stood up super fast and looked furious. Let me also remind you that this is in the middle of class. 

Ben: what are you gonna do? Huh? Fight me?

Clyde:...

Ben: if you're not gonna do anything then sit down

Clyde:... *sits down*

Ben: exactly, you wussy.

My teacher never said a word. If I were him, after everything calmed down, I woulda told them to go to the office or something, cuz it was honestly awful. But this man just kept teaching. And because he didnt show authority, that's exactly why ben and clyde would act like this.

Thanks for reading!"
"Guidance counselor lies, makes me look at a corpse.","TLDR; Counselor negligently removes me from schoolgrounds without informing anyone and makes me attend my deceased brother's visitation and me whining about it.

A lifetime ago, while in elementary school, my older brother died in an accident. I only missed one day of school because of it. I was sort of a mature kid and I knew that I had to get back into routine, using school as a coping mechanism, I knew I needed normalcy, I wanted to just get past his death, act like it never happened. His death was emotionally stunting (obviously). I dont even remember crying, I just knew if I went back to school, everything would be okay. Cue the guidance counselor, or GC. 

A few days after his death, Im in a classroom where tryouts for a play are happening, very much a party atmosphere and I remember having a pretty good time with my friends. Suddenly, GC shows up and escorts me out of the room. She explains to me that my mother had called the school and she desperately wanted me to attend his visitation that was currently taking place. I just go along with it because she's the adult and Im the kid. GC takes me off campus in her personal vehicle. She never signs me out or informs anyone of taking me off campus. I dont think I need to explain to you just how horribly that could have gone under different circumstances. 

We arrived at the funeral home five minutes later after an uncomfortable car ride. In retrospect, I remember seeing my mother somewhat surprised to see me, but didnt think much of it at the time. Entering that room, I had never felt so small, everyone looked twelve feet tall to me that day. GC escorts me to the open casket. I just remember looking at him and thinking, ""he's wearing someone else's suit, he doesnt have a suit, he doesnt wear suits."" We were there for about five minutes in total, but long enough to cement that image in my brain forever. Now picture having to go back to school immediately after looking at the dead body of your sibling. 

Years later, I find out from my mother that she did not in fact call and tell GC that she wished for me to attend the visitation. This woman lied to a grief stricken child, secretly took me off school property, and made me get a good look at my brother's lifeless body. GC was very religious and I think in her mind, she decided that I wasnt dealing with his death properly. I really cannot wrap my head around GC thinking it was within reason for her to decide what was best for me. Not my family, not even me, but herself, a sanctimonious shrew with a flimsy counseling certificate that was probably incapable of a papercut. I wont even allow myself to consider the idea that she did this with malicious intent.

The most gutrenching aspect of the entire situation that angers me the most is that she stole the last memory/image I ever had of my brother. She stole something from me which  cannot be bought, cannot ever get back. It's sickening, vile, and borderline diabolical. I hope she never subjected another kid to something similar. I cant fathom how poorly that situation could have gone with a more vulnerable child. I think of her every so often and I feel so utterly wronged. It's one of the worst things Ive ever experienced, I know people have had worse things than this happen to them, but it left an indelibe mark on me, definitelty gave me trust issues. I promised myself if I ever saw her in public, I would go off on her even though I know I would look like a complete lunatic. I think Im more upset about what GC did than losing my brother at this point. The bitterness is palpable. 

Bonus points- Also years later, I found out the actual grade teachers informed the entire student body about my brother's death because why respect grief in any way?"
Roasting My High School,
"Middle School ""Guidence counsellor""","I use "" around guidence counsellor because she wasn't a good guidence counsellor.

I'm going to call her Miss. MIA because when you actually needed her she wasn't there for you.

So when I went into middle school for the first time, I didn't make any friends. I was a shy, overweight bookworm who didn't really talk in class. Nobody in the class really liked me and I was okay with that. I was fine reading by myself in the corner.

However Miss MIA did not think that was ok. She had a meeting with my parents and informed them that I was at risk of being ""anti-social""

My parents informed her that I had friends outside of school and was actively apart of my church's youth group. I was not anti-social.

Miss. MIA decided to completely ignore my parents and started to make me ""social"" She made me have lunch with a girl in a different class than me.

I'll call this girl, ""Abby"" Now Abby was a nice girl but she was very different from me. She came from a bad household and constantly talked about inappropriate things with me like suicide, drugs, drinking and abuse.

We didn't get along very well.

When Miss. MIA noticed I wasn't getting more ""social"" she decided that I must be depressed. So she started making me go to these girls group things where we learned about depression, suicide prevention and bullying.

I hated it. I wasn't depressed (yet) and I wasn't anti-social. I was just a shy girl who just wanted to read in the library.

When those groups weren't working she forced me into a exercise group we had at the school. I was overweight but very self-conscious. I walked the walking track we had but miss. MIA decided to have ""Abby"" try to encourage me.

It didn't help. Finally I grew a bit of a spine and quit everything that she was forcing me to do and joined the book club we had at school.

Then in 8th grade, I was being heavily bullied. I was called names like ""Beast"" ""Witch"" ""Whale"". I had rocks thrown at me on my way to school and was hurt in gym class.

I went to Miss. MIA and explained what was happening and how I needed help and she straight up told me..

""It's your fault for quitting the fitness club. Now you have to deal with the consequences.""

I dealt with it until I couldn't take it anymore. I broke down to my mom telling her everything. She was so mad.

She went and had a meeting with all my teachers and they all said the same thing. That everyone seemed to like me at the start of the year so I must have been being dramatic.

My mom told them ""No"" I wasn't being dramatic. I was nearly suicidal at that point. What did Miss. MIA have to say?

She smiled smugly and said that she tried to help me but I had quit.

I had quit because her ""help"" wasn't helpful. But when I did need her help She was also no help.

So that's my middle school ""guidence counsellor"""
Photo from my professor: Read precious post,
Teacher spends more time talking about how she isnt racist than actually teaching.,"I'm a freshman at a high school with mostly Mexican students, including myself (this is important), and my honors English teacher is white. Because of the amount of minorities at my school, my teacher constantly tries to prove that she isn't racist. Whenever anything about race is brought up she immediately goes on a tangent about ""i love black people"" ""Martin Luther King jr is my idol"" ""I don't like the n word"" and we all just tell her we believe her and to just get on with the lesson. Anyway, I play baseball for my school, so I wear a hat everyday to make the dress out before practice easier on myself. My teacher, however, uses this in one of her tangents about not being racist. We were talking about bullying and she said she gets bullied because of the school she teaches at, because we're notorious for having gang fights daily. While going on this tangent, my teacher said ""I don't think we have any gang members in this class, except maybe LordHoomin122 because he wears a hat and flannel everyday."" Regardless of whether this was a joke or not, it pissed me off and ruined my day, and it was extremely ignorant. I didn't show how angry it made me but seriously, she is one of the worst teachers I've ever had."
A constant referral teacher,"I had a teacher in the 5th grade that with every little thing I would do, good or bad, she would give me a referral. One time I TAPPED not hit, TAPPED my friend on the head with a lunch tray and she gave me a referral. Moral of the story don't go to Sorenson science academy and don't talk to mrs. Heap, I hope I never see you again, screw you mrs. heap."
So my teacher doesn’t understand science. He’s also a professor.,"So during my class, my teacher decided to tell us that the Law of Conservation of Mass is just dependent upon the perspective of the viewer. For one of our quiz questions, he basically said that mass within a closed system can be changed due to temperature, even though the mass is within a closed system. 

He has now said that when an atom loses a proton, it becomes positively charged."
My teacher who stalked me from a corner just to get me and my friends into trouble,"Here's some background. So my school has this thing called AV or Audio/ Visual class. We would get assignments from our awesome teacher that usually required us to go out around the school and record videos. We had a little pass that told us we had permission to do so. Here's the cast.

Me

Friend one: F1

Friend two: F2

Friend three: F3

Butthole teacher: BT

Awesome Teacher: AT

AT had assigned us to recreate a music video which we were all so excited about. We couldn't decide on a song to settled with one F2 suggested called Dance Monkey. (Not a good song but fun to film.) So F1, 2, 3 and I get our passes and head out to film. We film the first part of the video in a hallway that had windows that F2 could sit at and lip sync. While doing this I notice BT watching us from far away. I don't say anything because I know who she is. (BT is actually the head of the tech department of my school. She was promoted to that position just that year. She used to be just a regular tech teacher and no one liked her. She was rude to everyone in the class.) Anyway so I ignore her and go back to discussing what to do next with my group. After recording outside for a bit then coming back in again I notice BT around the corner once more. She was just standing there and watching us. I ignore her again and focus on my project.

F1: we look so stupid in this.

Me: yea but it's funny, so that's all that matters. What should we do next?

F3: maybe another window shot?

F2: again?

Then from behind us we hear BT say, in an annoyed voice: Um What are you guys doing?!

We all just stand there and look at each other.

Me: um we are part of AV and are recording a music video. 

We all show her our passes, showing we were telling the truth.

BT: Well I haven't seen much Recording going on.

This was weird to me because I literally saw her watching us the entire time.

F1: oh we have. We are just taking about what to do next.

Me: yea I have the camera right here.

I hold up the camera which for some reason made her more annoyed.

BT: then show me what you've done.

I kinda rolled my eyes at her and show her the recordings. There was about 7 clips so I played like 3 of them. In one you can actually see her in the background watching us.

In a defeated tone BT says: Oh- alright. But how come you guys weren't recoding before I got here?

Me: because, we were discussing on what to do next.

BT: I don't need the back talk Miss...(looks at my badge) miss OP.

Who knew answering a teachers question was back talk..

BT: Just get recording.

With that she left out the school doors and we all were just left confused. I actually have never met her before this. Later I found out that BT complained to AT about us and how we were slacking off and rude.
Luckily AT knew that wasn't true at all. To this day she gives me and my friends a dirty look every time we pass her. But now she doesn't even talk to us. Is anyone else confused by this?"
My friend is blind,
Textiles Teacher Hated Me For No Reason,"Some context:
I studied textiles as one of my GCSE's and I was never really super friendly with the teacher as I was a shy kid. The worst of her behaviour was in the last year of GCSE's (yr11). Lastly, our teacher was a tiny blonde woman who had recently gotten married and acted super sweet and chatty to the other students. Let's call the teacher MrsT (for textiles) 

So here's everything I remember in order:
So, I was diagnosed with Anxiety in Feb of Yr 11 (super difficult at the time as the anxiety made me feel sick and would get worse out of nowhere). Bc of this I had to inform all my teachers so that they would understand if I needed to suddenly leave the class. All the other teacher's responses were super kind and understanding. But how MrsT responded will probably stay with me for a long time. I had asked her to talk in the hallway one lesson and we did. She stood there with her arms crossed, barely making eye contact and a bored af expression on her face (the opposite of her in front of other students). I told her about how I was struggling and I may need to leave at some points to re-collect myself due to the anxiety. Her expression and body language remained the same. Uncaring. When I was done, she just goes 'Okay, well if you excuse me I have other students to go and talk to'. And before I could even say 'thanks' or 'ok', she walks back into the classroom, leaving me in the hallway. One of the most awful things I had experienced tbh. But that was nothing compared to how she behaved shortly after.

MrsT would also never spend any time working with me on my projects, she would look through my book maybe once every 2 weeks and not say anything and just walk away. But with any other student she would offer them advice or guidence and compliment their work. She actively avoided me, but when she wanted to offer her opinion on my work it was never constructive or helpful, she would just order me to make a sewing sample with a technique I didn't want to do and after suggesting it, wouldnt let me say no to doing it. She would either tell me what to do or ignore me completely. 
So she did this a lot, and some of the students who sat near me started to notice it. However, one time she went too far, and everyone saw how evil this woman was to me.

One lesson I showed up and had done 2 A3 pages of work the night before. I was tired af but kept my sh*t together as always. MrsT went around checking everyone's books for their work (did I mention she would check on everyone on my table but me, check on the rest of the class and then check on me last). When she finally got to me, she had the book out infront of her, flipping through the pages. I stood their awkwardly, my anxiety getting worse as it always did (yes, this woman looking at my book made my anxiety spike because of how she was). She gets to the new work... looks at it for like 10 seconds... and without hesitation...

rips the two A3 pages (approx 5 hours of work total) clean out of the book. And if that wasn't bad enough that she didn't even ask me if it was OK to do that or tell me why, she screwed up the pages and threw them in the bin near us. At this point the whole class was silent and staring (normally a loud class). She throws those pages away, stares me coldly in the face and says 'Don't ever do anything like that again'. I was shaken to my core. Never had a teacher disrespected me like this and did so without hesitation. I worked hard in her class, stayed quiet, asked for help if I needed it, and it wasn't like I was just obliviously awful at the subject as I ended up getting a 6 (B grade) in the subject.

That was when I had about enough. After she ripped out the pages, I asked her 'what else do you think I should do then?' I sounded shaken and scared. She just glanced at me and went 'I'm not sure yet, I'll get back to you'. She didn't talk to me for the rest of the lesson.

That Lunchtime I went to my head of Yr and told her everything (the not caring about my mental health struggles and basically destroying my book and refusing to fix it as well as her ignoring me all the time) . She was super understanding and said she was going to have a chat with MrsT. The next week, MrsT asked to talk to me outside. She said in a tone that sounded like she was pretending, 'I'm sorry about last week, I shouldn't have just took the pages out and not helped you, I was just really stressed because I was moving house.'
I just said thanks and we went back to class. 

Yeah, the fact you have enough money to move to a nice house doesnt excuse that kind of behaviour. Also did you forget the part where I was struggling with anxiety and you've been causing me problems way before the book incident? Apparently so.

I was going to take Textiles for A Levels, but after this I didn't. Doged a bullet there. She still sucks. Shes also pregnant now, rip to that poor kid who doesn't even exist yet.

Don't know if the situation was as bad as I thought, was I making it seem worse? Idk anymore. Let me know what you think of this and I'll see ya around. Thanks for reading, kind stranger."

my ...interesting gym teachers,"preface: i’ve gone to public school my whole life, and as you can probably guess; they have some rather interesting teachers. 

the story: this was 7th grade PE, my first time having to “change out” for a class, since it was my first year of middle school. before the class really started, for the first few days we were just told what all was going to happen during the year (what we would learn, how everything was going to work etc) and then they separated the boys and the girls (i’m now a 16 year old girl, i was 12 at the time) we got a lecture from the rather strict female gym teacher, and then she started talking about uniforms. now, pretty much everyone bought their gym uniforms on open house night before the school year even started, so she was really talking about what would happen if we didn’t wear them one day and other things like that. she then went on to tell us that we should all buy a sports bra if we didn’t already have one. i personally at the time and up until very recently, always wore sports bras. they were easier and more comfortable to me. but she wasn’t telling us this so that WE would feel more comfortable and be easier to move around, she told us because when we run “all the boys’ eyes will just go 👀👀” and looking back on that now, it seems a little weird to tell your 12 year old students that all the boys are going to be creepy and stare at our chest the whole class. of course i thought nothing of it at the time, we were all still developing and all of that was kind of new to us. needless to say, she wasn’t exactly my favorite teacher. there was also another thing that happened when we went into health (sex ed and drug lessons lol) and she told us all to say “penis” out loud to get it over with. it was all very weird and awkward. 7th grade PE was on something else tbh."
I use self defense and get triple the punishment than the kid,"I'm a 13 yr old and go to a middle school. 
Yet I don't have the best reputation in my school.
So with that out of the way here's the cast

Douche, D
Teacher, T
Principal, P
Friend, F
Me, Me

I was in the cafeteria eating my lunch and was sitting by my F (on my left) and D (on my right).
I was half way through my lunch when to my right and this kid had 4 juice boxes all empty. D turned back at me and for what ever reason he started throwing juice boxes at my face. I instantly got mad yet confused. 'Why did he do that ' I thought.
I pinched him in the face and got up (I new this was self defense cause no one likes juice boxes in the face (not the real reason)) and started telling at this kid.
Me: why the f*** did you do that you r****d.
I hit once more and he was shocked.
I thought I almost made him s*** himself from the look on his face. 
T also notices what I was doing.
T: Go to the cafeteria safe seat
Me: But he hit-
T: I don't care just go
I willingly went and waited the entire time.
I stopped that same teacher that sent me,
Me: sry but I was using self defense so why am I here
This teacher replies with the stupidest way
T: there is no self defense
I was like what.
It took for ever for lunch to end.
I unfortunately had to go to the principals office. 
I was sitting in there explaining my side of the story and so does D.
His story was the same as mine and the security
Footage. 
The principal agreed that it was self defense.
Long story short I got the rest of the day of ISS and 3 days of OSS. And D just got 1 day of ISS.
My mom was livid that was D punishment."
A Horrid Man,"First post here so please don't hate on me, just on this guy.

Alright so I had this guy back in elementary school beginning in 3rd grade, he was the ""Computer Science"" teacher. The teacher who we'll call R (reason will be explained later) had the idea that teaching was sitting at his desk for most of the period while making us use a website he made to teach kids how to type quickly. (Spoiler alert: It didn't help) Now in the school I went to it was considered a specials class meaning that it would rotate daily between the other 3 music, gym, and art.

R is an old white guy, gray hair, skinny except his beer belly, balding, and he just had this creeper feeling about him. So when I had his class and he actually got out of his seat he would barely help any of the guys and would walk much slower and give in depth help to the girls, this already set off red flags. Now to my knowledge he never did anything to anybody in my grade, however I found out last year, my senior year, that the year beforehand he was caught by a **fourth grader watching porn IN CLASS on a SCHOOL COMPUTER!** That wasn't even the worst of it though, the student went to the principal about it and nothing was done, then I learned that he's a **F\*\*\*ING Pedophile**, he has actually shoved his hand into a fifth grader's pants, the girl must have been mortified. But that's not what pushed me over the edge with this guy, what did it was my little brother. 

Last year he had R. (and if you haven't figured it out yet R stands for rapist and retard, nothing against people who are actually retarded sorry if that upsets you) Now a crucial piece of information both me and my brother are on the autism spectrum so we are emotionally hurt much easier, and we have trouble focusing on tasks assigned to us. So my little brother was having a hard time in the class so he was going to ask for some help so doing the only thing he could do to get R's attention he got out of his seat and walked up to him. R almost immediately shouted at my brother for being out of his seat and told him that he wouldn't get any help. When my brother got back to his seat and kept trying to work R said to him ""You're a disgrace to your family."" I found this out yesterday and I was pissed. Now if all of that isn't bad enough the school district decided that rather than fire this guy they were just gonna move him from the elementary school to the high school. 

Isn't school supposed to be a place where you can go as a second home and feel safe, and aren't teachers supposed to build students up, not tear them down?"
"Deputy head decides to split up our form, making everyone cry, including our form teacher.","We think that the deputy head has hated our form teacher (since he once tried to cancel revision booklets that he said ""didn't work"" when we all loved them) but today was the final straw. 

It was just me and one of my fiends and someone else in form this morning when our head of year and one of my form teacher's friends walks in to our class to talk to our teacher, who is crying. So they send us out into the corridor for a minute so they can talk privately and we're thinking that maybe her son (2) had died. We were let back in to find her still in tears and we ask her if she's alright and she said ""No. I'll tell you all when everyone is here"" 

So when everyone is in our form teacher sits in the centre table and tell us through tears ""there's no way to tell you this but me and [head of year] have been trying our best but [the deputy head] and [head of humanities] are splitting you up and moving you to different forms in the mornings"". Apparently it's for R.E intervention for people who's grades aren't quite high enough.

There's one person who wasn't in today and everyone is dreading to think how she will react as she has enough on her plate as it is. Thankfully, the prefects are talking to the head and deputy head about letting us stay as we are but until we hear back, we will all be in different forms  with teachers none of us like and without their friends for the next four months until college."
This Is One Of The Worst Health Teachers... And I've Had Her Two Years In A Row,"So, to give you a description of this monster, She is as big as the School Bus, She Waddles like a Penguin when she walks, and whenever she trips there is a Ten Mile Earthquake. And Obese is a degraded version of what she is. She just can't be described as Obese, maybe like 2x Obese.  


Now, with that description out of the way, she sounds like you just want to die. It is not a voice to hear. With some of her famous quotes being... ""Supermarkets have a Healthy Section, and everything else is unhealthy."" ""If none of you quiet down I'll keep you all after class, and you'll also get detention."" And her most famous one to me. ""When do you want to die!?""  


Lets talk about the front row, or as we at school call it, The Splash Zone. You know those events where you hit people with Water Balloons? This row is like that, but whenever she talks you have a chance to be hit with a pound of saliva right on your face. I once sat there and had to crawl under my desk to avoid this Water Balloon of saliva.  


I could keep going for days but I want to try to keep this short to go play with my cat. But to anyone who gets this teacher I feel horrible and wish you the best of luck with her, and The Splash Zone."
Teacher OC,
Mrs lemerand,"Mrs Lemerand is the worst goddamn teacher

Mrs. Lemerand, a health teacher. If you can even call her that. She is really in all honesty the opposite of what a health teacher should be. She is old andfat. When I say fat I don’t mean just fat. When she walks,the classroom underneath her is shaking. She also spits all over the 1st row or as I like the splash zone where I unfortunately sit. I have been soaked in her spit it is disgusting. 


She also goes rants after talking about the lesson for 3 minutes. These rants don’t go on for a minute or two. They go on for half the damn class. These rants contain such things as the government should make the cigarette sellers stop selling cigarettes. Not to children just to everyone. Like does she even know how things like these work. Or the time she spent all of the class period telling us that you should eat half of a potato rather than all of it. Like what the hell is that supposed to mean?

She also talks about being healthy when I’ve seen her eat a full on Twinkie in the halls during class and also drinks at least 2 pops a day. When she’s saying only drink water and you have 12 ounces of water. Not even that right amount.

She also claims that snow is warm. I’m not fucking you. And she teaches science as well, how the hell is that even allowed. 

Mrs. Lemerand, if your reading this I would love a neck reveal."
Getting Suspended,"I was in 2ND GRADE by the way.
I was joking around with the teacher saying “I’d rather die then doing that” I forgot what I said but it was something like that but I said it wrong. My teacher told the principal and when I was leaving school they took me and asked me what am I scared of, I said Candyman bc my grandpa told me about him, so I told her the truth being all innocent, she asked me if I wanted to kill myself. I had no idea what that meant so I was confused, and so I didn’t say anything, she sent me out the room and I left school crying. I was let out of school for 2 days to see a psychiatrist for no reason. They’ve just been talking to me every year. They keep forcing me to see the psychiatrist. They basically ruined my happy childhood."
My Chef Curses at a Random Guy,"Sorry this is a tad bit long
When I was 11 years old 6th grade I was waiting for lunch in line I was always the last in line, so I was alone. There was no lunch lady there, so me being a none confrontational person I was just waiting for my food, next thing you know there is knocking at a back door in our lunch room closer to the chef and me the lunch table are farther away, so the chef thinks it’s a package so she opens the door a guy starts to charge at her. She was a bit big so she blocked him and pushed him out. She cursed at him with very intense words, then she shut the door and looked at me. It went like this...
Chef curses at guy.
Closes the door and walks to me.
She was young and she probably didn’t want to get fired.
Chef: Now what did I say
Me: Hi how are you doing, what do you want
Then we parted ways. 
That’s how I ended up bringing my own lunch to school later on."

Another Story of my Worse English Teacher Ever!,"((This is the same teacher from this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/badteachers/comments/bz7z2s/the\_worse\_english\_teacher\_ever/](https://www.reddit.com/r/badteachers/comments/bz7z2s/the_worse_english_teacher_ever/) ))  


So here's the story. I was at my local library this past week and I picked up a book. I got home and looked at it closer and it brought back this certain experience from my horrible English teacher from High school.  


Cast  
Me: Me  
ET: English Teacher  


My English class had reading logs. We had to read a certain number of books in order to receive credit at the end of the year. Luckily for me, I have been an avid reader since Grade 1. So I was looking for another book to reach on her bookshelf that she had at the back of the classroom. I found the book ""Fan Girl"" by Rainbow Rowell.  


If you haven't read this I shall recommend that you do. It's a wonderful book. It's about a girl going to collage and she writes fan fiction. Anyway, I picked up the book and finished reading it in about a week. It's a 445 page book so i finished it quite fast for somebody who only gets 5 minutes a class to read it.  


So I finished the book and started to write in my reading log when ET stops me.  


ET: You can't use that for your reading log.  


Me: Why not?  


ET: Because it's fan fiction.  


Me: No. It's about a girl who writes fan fiction. But the book itself is not fan-fiction.  


ET: I don't care about what you think about it. It doesn't count.  


Me: Yes it does. It's a book. It was on your bookshelf that you said at the start of the year that could count towards our logs.  


ET: It doesn't count! I'll prove it to you! \*She walks out\*  


She's gone for most of class. When she comes back she comes over to my desk where I am now sitting.  


ET: I went and asked every English teacher in the school as well as the guidance counselor and We've all decided..it counts.  


I looked at her. I looked her straight in the eyes and said in the most monotone voice ever.  


""That was a big waste of your time""  


I got in trouble for sass that day. But when I told my mom what had happened she was not mad at me.  


So yeah. There is that."
"Insane Psychology ""Professional""","I waited after high school to go to college. Between military, marriage, and kids, I didn't end up going until I was mid 30s. I went to a community college for those first 3 years (single mom, full time job. It took an extra year for that 2 year degree) I was in my last semester and finally took that psychology class. I got stuck with the worst psychology teacher imaginable (IMO). A list of his actions:
1: The class of 20 was esentially split into 2 groups. Those who had names (the traditional students), and the 6 of us that were over 22 who were only referred to as ""senior"". He never once said any of our names in class.
2: Removed one student from the senior group and would only call him ""Wheels"", I assume because he was in a wheelchair.
3: Gave us some 10 minute teacher created test about what we think of human nature, made us line up according to our scores (trusting vs. untrusting), and spent the rest of the class calling all those that fell on the untrusting side of his test KKK members, and the most untrusting score was the ""Grand Dragon"". Fun fact, 6 of the 8 POC were in the KKK that day, including the grand dragon. Everyone on trusting side was called Pollyanna (funny that a male POC was also the ""Queen Pollyanna"")
4: Another class, we had to break into groups and do a survey of our group. I forget about what. He gave out those poster sized post-it's that we had to put on the wall to make a graph of our results. I was (sadly) voted the one to do the graph. He laughingly told the class that I clearly had OCD because I used a ruler to draw my lines.
5: He made up some BS math equation for IQ that made sure that the younger you are, the higher your ""IQ"" was. I missed the class, so had to come in early to do it. It was me and some 18 yo scholarship jock. After figuring out the number and (of course) saying it out loud, he laughed as the jock asked, ""Why are old people so stupid?"". When class started, he made a comment about how some people just don't know when to stop talking. Kicked me out of class when I loudly said, ""No, they don't"", looking straight at said jock.
6: For some reason, we had one class where we had to look at UNEDITED AUTOPSY PHOTOS. No real reason. Just an entire class looking at photos I will never unsee.
7: We were talking about addiction. I had a cup of coffee on the edge of my table. He laughed as he grabbed it up and called me a ""baby drug addict"" as his bubba mug of coffee set on his desk. But upside, I went from senior to baby in one class. Call me Benjamin Button. And the ass never gave my coffee back.
There were a lot more little jabs, but those are the major highlights. I must admit, the coffee incident was my hill to die on.
I had noticed something through my time in that class (this was just shy of halfway through). His class time counted for nothing in your grade. All his graded work was online. However, he was so busy planning his sadistic class activities (It seriously felt like I was trapped in a twisted version of the Stanford prison experiment), he didn't bother to spend time creating his own questions, and they were all multiple choice. You could bring up your test/quiz, Google the question, and find not only the question (word for word), but the answer (also word for word and even the same letter answer). This is the only time I ever stepped outside of my academic integrity. I googled my way through every assignment, got an A, and never had to see that ass again.
Or so I thought. We get to graduation. It is, of course, a bit of a mess moving around 1,000 graduates from all majors (including psychology majors) and getting the ceremony done. My family and I decide to go to dinner after the ceremony, plus all the cheesy personal photos, are done. As we are walking in to the restaurant, take one guess who is walking out with his wife.
Yep, it's him. I took great petty pride in sticking my foot out there, tripping him, and saying, ""I'm so sorry. You know how us seniors just mess things up.""
Can you imagine not only making it through a psychology major with an ass department head, but also him not even think your graduation was worth attending? Every department head that had graduates was there, save one.
I waited until my diploma and records were in my hot little hand, then wrote a much more detailed letter than this to the college.
The worst part...he was actually a practicing psychologist at the time. I don't know how he treated his patients, but I shudder to think who else suffered at his hand. I can't prove it, but I have suspicions that he was mining info for a paper. On what, I have no clue. His class (graded part) was basic terms and definitions, yet (class time) a study on reactions."
What's the worst teacher you have ever had?,"Mine was one in the third grade where I was apparently his ""favorite student"" but yet he treated me like crap. When other students were bullying me, he wouldn't give a duck. There was also this one time when something fell out of my desk and he got hella angry and told me to stand up. So, I did as he said only because I was scared. Then he took my desk and shook the hell out of it, dumping all off my pencils and papers out and shouting ""LOOK AT THIS MESS! WHAT IS THIS!?""  While the whole class was just staring in horror. He forced me to staying during recess and clean my desk out, while STILL shouting at me about how messy I was. It was humiliating. He never did that to anyone else. God knows why. And that wasn't even the worst thing he did. Thank goodness that it didn't get worse than yelling. Anyways sorry about the longness of this one. So yeah what's yours?"
My science teacher got arrested,"I am still in shock that this happened. So on thanksgiving around 2am my science teacher got pulled over. When the cop searched his car they found almost 300 Xanax, marijuana,$600,and hash oil.
The day everyone found out. 
    School had just ended for the day and I was waiting for my mom to pick me up. While waiting my friend came up to me and said he got arrested. I was shocked/surprised. When I got in my mom's car I told her. The next day that was all we talked about. It has been a month and we still talk about it. Did I mention that we had a drug assembly a week before. And he got arrested before he became a teacher.

Question for members of this sub,Yall think rSlash (the YouTuber) should cover this sub?
Succy Teacher Tries to Separate me From my Parents," When I was in the third grade I had this teacher who would always single me out. She would treat everyone else like they were her grandchildren (even though she was, like, in her thirties) , but treat me like an army instructor would (this is partly my fault because I had very bad behavior problems at the time). This went on for a couple of months before I finally told my parents. I guess they sent the school an e-mail, because the next day, she was nicer to me. Near the end of the day, she asked me about the bruises on my legs (I rode my bike after school a lot, and the day before, I had a nasty fall and scraped and bruised my legs badly). I told her that, and she said something along the lines of. ""Hmmmm... That's concerning..."" I thought nothing of it. The next day, I was pulled out of class in the middle of the day. I was escorted to the school's conference room and there was a **\*CPS WORKER\*** waiting for me (I didn't know what CPS was at the time, or even that she was part of it)! She asked me a bunch of questions like,""How well do you and your parents get along"", ""Do you get spanked"", etc., etc. But I'll never forget what my teacher said to me when I came back into the classroom. ""Do you feel nERVoUS??"" Fricc you, Priscilla Grey!"
My bad teacher from Year 2,"When I was in Year 2, when I was around 7, I had a teacher who was kind. But she lied about students in the worst way possible. Whenever a student transferred schools, she would tell the class in a sad manner that the kid died. She wasn't joking or anything. She was dead serious. I know this was bullshit because when I was 11, when I started secondary school, a girl who she claimed to have died, sat next to me, in my class. I'm disgusted. You don't lie or joke about a child dying. That's someone's fucking child."
My Cousin's Math Teacher,"I got told this yesterday at a family gathering and I'm pissed at this teacher.

My cousin and his younger brother live in a small town. They both play hockey and are very sporty and athletic.

The oldest cousin (15M) has decided he wants to be a gym teacher. Cool.

However he is failing math because his math teacher told him ""You don't have to be smart to be a gym teacher""

He doesn't do his math now because his teacher only cares about helping the ""smart"" kids.

He's actually quite good at math. But he doesn't do it because of his math teacher.

This makes me so mad. Why do teachers say things like this to students?"
My teacher made me do a presentation in front of a whole Shopping center.,"I'm sorry if my english isnt the best, im from Serbia and Austria.

So what happend was , we had to do a public presentation( in the last year of middle school )for our home countries , mine being serbia. At it doesnt sound so bad at first , but for me it was the most terrifying thing in my life. I was 14 at the time.
I was being bullied for coming from Serbia , most of my bullies were also from the balkan area , so its kinda self explanatorie why they bullied me.They always showed me pictures of the serbien/Kosovo war , told me that its my fault that serbia did so many terrible things , told me its my fault that those dumb wars began.The list goes on.(im sorry again for my bad english).In the last year , my teacher (who knew that i wasnt very fond of my heritage , and knew that i am ashamed of it) thought it would be a good idea to do those presentations in one of the most popular shopping centers in vienna, to show people how many cultures are mixed in our school and of course to promote the school.
A few weeks before the actual thing started , I told the teacher that im not confident enough to do this, and that my bullies would probably interupt my presentation with their comments.The teacher ignored it and told me that i should get over it and if not my grades would go 1 grade lower meaning I would've been bellow avrage if i didnt do it. There was a second teacher ( my hungarian teacher) who was actually very nice and told me , that even thou my home did dumb things , i shouldnt feel bad or responsible.She was very supporting and understanding , but still i had to do it.

during the practises , my bullies decided to interrupt me every possible way they could. My teacher didnt care and shouted at me that my work wasnt good enough and that I should shout over the noise the bullies were making. At this point , I was extremly frustrated. I told my teacher that I wasnt proud of my home and that I wouldnt do it , completly forgetting that my bullies were in the same room.Of course that set her of and my mother was called. Apparently I! was interrupting the other students with my constant complaining and whining.
My mom screamed at me for being interuptive and I got grounded for a month. After the call I couldnt take it anymore and ran home crying , ignoring my teachers screaming after me to come back.
The next day my bullies made fun of me for being a cry baby and told me and I qoute:,, You serbians , only making drama , and if it isnt about you , you go full on crazy"" I went to the teacher and she didnt believe me and told me to stop lying. I went to the nice teacher and she said that people like them will always exist.(Still she couldnt do anything about it)

After 2 days of drama the presentations began. I was first , and i was kinda glad , I was allowed leave earlier because of that. But anyways the presentation began , and the first thing I see is my mom and my teacher( the bad one) arguing.Next to them were my bullies.Aperrantly they brought eggs with them to throw at me during my presentation. My Mom was behind them And shouted at them in front of hundrets of people. My teacher was furious not at the kids , But at my mom , because she was sticking up for me and took the eggs away from my bullies. My teacher shouted at my mom saying that she cant just take ""school property"" and should give the kids the eggs back . At this point everyone heard my teacher Including my principal. ( I stopped talking so I could hear what was going on) 
Turns out my teacher planned for the bullies to throw eggs at me. She was shocked/f**ked to say the least. She was fired. 
My mom took me out of the last month of school and i was ungrounded."
"Divas, Primadonnas, Narcissists, and Teachers",
My downright mean 3rd grade teacher,"In 3rd grade, I had a mean teacher that we will call Mrs. G. She was immensely rude and took things to the next level. I distinctly remember 3 incidents that shocked me to the core. 

The first incident happened when we were coming inside from recess. I had a good friend who we will call P. P was doing nothing wrong, then a girl who we will call I steps in and makes these rude remarks. P is offended and apparently Mrs. G hears. Does she get onto I for making rude remarks? NO! She turns to P and screams at her in front of the entire class. The part that shocked me though was when she told P “Mean girls get hit by buses!” Immediately, P burst into tears. Mrs. G just stood there and looked proud.

The second incident happened after an active shooter drill. My class was goofing off during it. I know, you may not side with us, I understand, but the worst is yet to come. May I remind you, it is a DRILL. We go back and Mrs. G just goes off on the entire class. Then, out of the blue, she yells, “I would throw you out of this classroom during a lockdown even if the shooter was in the hallway.” That messed me up for a few days. In fact, she got written up twice by the principal for threats. The very next day she just laughs and says it was a joke. I don’t think you joke about involuntary manslaughter.

The third and final incident was also in class. This situation is not as long but is still twisted. We were working on math, I believe, and she was just on an endless tangent about bragging about how she beats her children for fun. Whose heart is that black and cold for someone to say that?

Thank you for listening to my rant."
My overreacting maths supply teacher,"Had a substitute in maths. We’ll call her Mrs C.
Now mrs C is incredibly grumpy and strict. We have a seating plan where I happen to sit next to one of my good friends Ava. 
The lesson begins and she hands out a worksheet. Let’s remember this room is filled with 15 year old and we’re all hyper since this is the last maths lesson before Christmas break. 
She demands we do the Christmas activity sheet in silence and don’t use a calculator.
We’re all agonizingly bored and start messing around.
So I decide to write a note to Ava: 
‘This lesson is so depressing’ 
The teacher then spots this note, snatches it and begins to shout. 
“ OP get your stuff and get out !”
Shocked I get my stuff and rush out of the room. I then start panicking outside the room, (I have general Anxiety and one of my triggers is disappointing people / getting in trouble). 
This was my first time getting kicked out of class, let alone getting in trouble.
She then kicks another girl out for borrowing a pen from another girl.
In my school we have a system where teachers can call for senior leadership team to come down and help. 
So she does. On me. 
Into the corridor walks, my hero 1 ( my German teacher. Senior leadership)  and my hero 2 ( my the Australian maths teacher). 
They see me and my panicked state and start to ask why they were called. 
I explain the situation and the teacher walks out of the classroom and starts shouting ( again ) about how rude I was and how she doesn’t want me in her classroom. 
Seeing how I did nothing wrong the maths teacher says I’m welcome to join the other top set for their maths lesson as they were playing a game. 
But the crazy sub says I should get isolated. 
So my German teacher says she’ll take me to student services.
When we reach her office she laughs. 
“ well if that happened in my lesson we’d just laugh about it. I’m not giving you isolation and I’ll make sure nothing goes on the system” 
She then let me sit at one of the computers, watch reddit videos and she brought me a biscuits. God I love my German teacher, a whole ass legend"
"[College Math] Calculus Professor will not admit to wrong, grades inconsistently, and is unreasonable with respect to student comprehension of the material.",\[deleted\]
I Had Professor Umbridge for a Math Teacher: Part 1 of 2 of the Worst Teachers I Had,"This is the first part in a saga about a couple of the teachers I had growing up. This one is about my middle school math teacher, whom we shall call henceforth Mrs. Umbridge. The reason is that she is a non-magical version of her. 
Anyway, let's begin. 
Mrs. Umbridge taught my math class in 8th grade. The school I went to was small and super old (the building itself has been around before my great grandmother was born) and was in a rural area near the Blue Ridge Mountains. So the school wasn't that too good. Many of the faculty were not very experienced in dealing with students who had disorders or other mental defects. Mrs. Umbridge was proof of how something like that could go horribly wrong.
Mrs. Umbridge was a middle-aged woman whose hair changed colors at least every couple of weeks (sometimes she was blonde, sometimes she was brunette, and sometimes she was a redhead). She was like Umbridge because she was always so cheerful and friendly but she could often be, well....a real bitch. Whenever a student made a mistake, had difficulty understanding and doing the work, or was just goofing off in the slightest way like whispering during class, she would go OFF. Like, she would lecture and shout and rant. When we would go anywhere in a line and we would go slow or mess around, she would get ssoo mad. Once she ranted at us about wasting people's time, taking up most of the classtime with this rant instead of actually teaching us anything (oh the irony). And the things she would say to students were so harsh. I specifically remember one time she told a student that she had seen a cat who worked a remote have better skills than him. I'm not making this up! She actually said that to a student! 
And she was hardly any better with me. Along with Autism, I also have ADHD, depression, and anxiety. And math was one of my hardest subjects. It certainly wasn't any easier with the teacher I had in that subject. Everytime I would ask Mrs. Umbridge for help she would come over and she would do things like point out anything else I did wrong even though I didn't ask her about them and she would even suddenly walk away when I still needed her help or despite the fact that I didn't get to bring up the problem I was having. I would have my arm raised up until it felt tired or uncomfortable trying to get her attention. And when she did help it only left me more confused and stressed out. This would just get her annoyed. 
I had three incidents with her that I remember fairly well.
The first one took place very early on in the school year. We had literally just came back from summer break and were just getting settled in to our new classes. Umbridge had us do homework, which I was hardly aware of. So I ended up missing a lot of it and I didn't know this until she told me that I got lunch detention. I was stunned because I had never in my life gotten into any trouble like that in school. I told her I had no idea about the homework and that nobody had told me about it but she didn't listen and I was still sent into detention, in tears.  
The second incident was when we were doing warm ups questions on the whiteboard and she had me do one of them. I told her I was uncomfortable doing it because I didn't feel confident about my answer. She acted understanding and told me that making mistakes was all part of learning. So I did what she asked and I wrote down my answer on the board. When we went over the questions and she reached the one I did, she said out loud, ""Who did this one?"" I said that I did. And she responded that I did it wrong and went on to correct the whole thing. She did all of this in front of the class and I was left feeling embarrassed and stupid. 
The third happened in class one day when we had just come back from lunch. At that time I had just gotten my visit from Aunt Flo (if you know what I mean) and I was in bad shape. I know that most people are uncomfortable when they go through their cycles but for me it was more than uncomfortable. At that time I didn't know yet that I have PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome). My cramps were agonizing, so much so that as I sat there at my desk I was on the verge of tears and could barely move from the pain. I was even whimpering. Some of the students had noticed this and asked me if I was alright. Umbridge noticed too and she took me out into the hallway. She asked me if I was having my period and when I told her I was she began to 'remind' me that it was all part of being a woman and that I was going to have to learn to suck it up. Then we went back to class and carried on with the lesson. No suggesting that I go to the nurse or anything like that whatsoever. 
So, yeah, that was Mrs. Umbridge for you. A lady who acted sickeningly sweet but had a lousy temper and was a bad teacher."
I Loved Art But Not My Art Teacher: Part 2 of 2 of the Worst Teachers I Had,"This is the second edition in a couple of posts about the worst teachers I had. This one is about an art teacher I had in high school. 
I’ve always been passionate about art and for so long I’ve wanted to be an artist. But I almost came to hate art and change my mind about my dream because of the experience I had with my Junior year art teacher. 
Let’s call him Mr. W. 
Mr. W taught a level 2 drawing and painting class. I had passed the first level class and moved onto the second. And from there Mr. W put my love for art to the test. 
Mr. W turned out to be one of those teachers who had favorites. And he made that clear from the beginning by spending more time with these students, talking with them and giving them more attention than the other students even when they wanted help. He would also always show off artwork (which was always SUPER difficult and realistic styled) done by these students or students who didn’t even go to the school anymore. He never showed or mentioned the artwork of the other students. 
Plus he never really taught anything he would just go into these long, unnecessary lectures where he would repeat things over and over about stuff that shouldn’t take that long to discuss. This took up a lot of time and we would end up having much lesser time to work on our projects. 
Mr. W was also super nit picky. Every time I’d ask his help or show him my work he would point out the things that were wrong and give ‘suggestions’. He never said anything positive or along the lines of ‘good job’ or In like this or that’. And he would shrug it off by saying that I was going to get a LOT of criticism in art school and an art career. Meanwhile, he always praised the students that he favored. 
In spite of this I tried my absolute best and worked super hard in the class. I did projects that were big and complicated (full on portraits and big collages) and I would work on them for days, both in and out of class. Nevertheless, they never pleased him and he always nit picked them. Eventually, I decided that for once I would do a small and simple project. I based it off one of my favorite artists/writers Rupi Kaur and what I did was a small drawing showing the process of a flower wilting. I drew it out in pencil then traced it with a pen. I was very proud of how simple yet beautiful it turned out. Mr. W was not as impressed however. I finished the project a day or two before the deadline so I took a break and watched videos. Mr. W noticed and asked me about it. He did not like that I finished earlier and told me to add more stuff to my drawing. He even told me that he was not going to have me sit around and do nothing while everyone else worked. I was so shocked. There were students in the class who did nothing and spent the whole time watching video gameplays on YouTube. But I had always worked hard and did my best in that class and he was telling me that I was slacking off. 
Through the majority of my time in Mr. W’s class I began to hate art and seriously doubt myself. I hated it so much that I came so close several times to giving up entirely on being an artist. But when I finished the class I started to enjoy art again and try pursuing it again. Mr. W was totally toxic and a know-it-all who picked favorites and bullied the ones who didn’t meet his expectations."
Humiliated by 3rd grade teacher,"It was in my 3rd grade class with Mrs. Mastriano. Every Thurs we went out to do phys ed. I was born with pulmonary hemosiderosis, PA-  which is something like severe asthma, but inhalers were too weak, & juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. I was taking several experimental pills because I also had unexplained lung bleeding from time to time. One was a strong steroid which made me gain excessive weight. my doctor kept a note of all this in the main office with the nurse.

If I overexerted myself, I would hve an ""asthma attack"" where my lips turned blue and would begin coughing up blood. teacher KNEW all of that. well i guess this thursday, she had a bad day and decided to lay into me. as a class we were supposed to run a mile, which is 4 laps of our tiny track. I always walked it. That day I came in last as usual, and she pulled me in front of everyone out on the field.

""What the hell was that?"" She screamed, ""we were kept waiting for you to get your fat ass here!""

""I couldn't go any faster...you know already,"" I said quietly.

""you're NOT sick! You're fat and you need to go on a diet,"" she continued yelling.

I don't rremember what happned after that, but a couple of friends tried to comfort me, ""She's one to talk!"" they said.

I was so embarrassed, and still remember the whole thing 25 yrs later! I can't remember anything really before 6th grade, but that I do! I never told anyone in my family, and it turned me into a bully towards those who now called me fat (because she did it first, and word amongst students spread)

Flash forward, I'm in junior high and in band. I gain some self respect and quit bullying in elementary school.

However, I had gotten deathly sick for a full 2 weeks one time in 7th grade. I was bedridden and ran fevers of 102 deg f to 104 deg f daily. i was in and out of consciousness. all i could keep down was 1 tuna sandwich with a glass of apple juice every other day, even that was a struggle. As a result, I lost a lot of weight.

ok so, back to band. Our school was to perform at the same elementary school. I was happy and kinda tense. I hoped not to see Mrs. Mastriano.  Oh but no. After the performance, she startles me from behind, grabbing my arm and says, ""You look amazing! have you been dieting? I told you it would be good for you,"" she proclaimed! as if SHE helped me lose weight.

I was done with this b!tch and I responded, through clenched teeth, ""No. I was sick. I have always been sick. I almost died. Please don't touch me,"" and I walked away. I wasn't going to berate her for behaving unprofessionally years ago. I wasn't going to humiliate her the way she did me. I refused to stoop to her level.

IDK if she ever did the same thing to other kids. But I survived, and I am stronger for it mentally.

tl;dr teacher humiliates sick girl who returns years later and confronts her"
My teacher didn’t believe it was my work + teacher sexism stories,"So in 3rd grade (year 4), my reading teacher gave us an assignment. I finished the assignment, it was one of the things I really didn’t enjoy doing. I get very good grades, like extremely good, I’m gifted, I have an accelerated reading class now (6th grade) I also am in 7th grade enriched math, meaning I am doing MORE than the average 7th grader, as a 6th grader. My 3rd grade teacher. I turned in my work EARLY, another kid must have changed the name on my paper to their name and put my name on another paper with nothing on it. She comes up to me  and shows me “my” paper, now mind you I had very good handwriting for a 3rd grader, it looks better than some of my 6th grade peers right now, this handwriting was so bad and my name wasn’t capitalized, I HATE when my name is not capitalized. She says something along the lines of “You can’t turn this in, you’ll have to do it during recess” in her snotty voice. I forgot to mention she said that to me AFTER the grades were in, so I had no class time to work on it. She keeps me inside at recess for a good week and a half or so to do the paper again, I finished the paper in like a week maybe and turn it in. She doesn’t grade it, she kept me for as long as she wanted to. It took me a while to finish it because I was really sad and mad because I did the work and she didn’t believe me. I was really mad about her keeping me from going outside, not because I enjoyed recess I actually hated recess, but because it made me look that I was a bad kid, she had this board outside her classroom and it always said which kids were staying inside. She eventually gave me a F for the assignment, even though I did the assignment TWICE. 



Sexism story 1:
The teacher’s pencil sharpener was broken one day from a kid putting a colored pencil in it. She decided to keep the whole class inside for recess till she found out who. After about 4 days maybe she proclaims in front of a class of 3rd graders that “a girl wouldn’t do this because girls just wouldn’t” she sent out all the girls to recess. I don’t know what happened in that classroom during recess, but this just makes me mad.

Another thing:
My school had kids do stuff to help sometimes, like carry in bags for a Christmas store in the school, set out chairs for concerts, etc. Not that often though, every single time the secretary would say over the speaker to a specific class to send any number of strong children to help with something. Just so you know, I am really strong, I was the strongest person in my class at the moment. Almost every teacher sent all guys, except for maybe 1-2 feminist teachers, one of them sent all girls, another sent a few girls. I was always pissed when a teacher would tell the strongest GUYS to do something, because I was stronger than them 99% of the time. I proved to my one 5th grade (year 6) teacher that I was stronger than them in a tug of war we had during Olympic day (a day where we do exercising games and stuff). We had class tug of wars where the class was separated in half randomly, I chose the back knot to pull (the hardest spot), my team always won. Then we had one v one, I chose one of the strongest guys to face. Once the match started I pulled, he pulled, I drug him across that line so quickly, my friends were like “I KNEW IT” and other people were just shocked. Actually I didn’t drag him he flew, there was a point where he didn’t touch the ground. You can ask the guy, he’ll say he flew across that line so fast he didn’t even blink and he was over the line."
How my teacher plans lessons,
Help me please,"Edit: ignore the mistakes I’m a bit slow

I am in middle school and 14 years old, threw sixth and seventh I have never had a teacher like me (Except for miss B! Thx fam hope your enjoying retirement) I think I have one teacher I like this year (he’s a weeb) but my homroom teacher/ civics teacher is really crule, he’s nice to every single trouble maker in his class, for example I once talked to the guidance counselor about the kid behind me and how he is kicking my seat on purpose, so she told teacher and yeah he moved the kid for two days, once he was “better” He moved him back without the guidance counselor promission

lately when I’ve been talking to her about my problems she said he said he moved him. I don’t know what to do let’s get to the actual problem

My boyfriend is in that class with me, I have a total of three Friends in the entire school it’s a really big school by the way. Once in class while study hall, he accidentally hit my boob, not a big deal right? I’m used to that since I have bigger boobs, and he immediately started apologizing and it was obviously a accident the teacher school screamed at him. Saying he was going to write an email to our parents about PDA. I got in huge trouble because I’m not allowed to be dating, and today in the hallway I hugged him because I was sad and We got screamed at , Now hear me out I would understand if it’s a rule but it’s fucking not. We’ve hugged in front of multiple teachers. They done nothing they smiled. Some even talk about our relationship and ask questions like there are friends I really do appreciate those teachers I love science teachers they’re all so nice compared to others. My boyfriend Thinks it’s because he Doesn’t have a wife but I really think it’s because he hates me he hates my brother hits doesn’t have a wife but I really think it’s because he hates me he hates my brother and I got let out Of class early to grab a project. And I got back a little earlier than I expected so I had two minutes maybe three before the bell rang to go home so I’ll be at my locker like I usually do for my boyfriend, and I get yelled at by my teacher to hurry up and go upstairs To the bus I explained to him that the bell hasent rung and he’s never had a problem with anyone else waiting for there friends. I don’t think it’s fair that I have to go up early and get pulled away from people. I’m not here to drag pity, But this has given me some pretty dark thoughts about doing things to myself. But I have no one else to turn to so Reddit"
Getting yelled at because of a timed quiz,"I remember being in grade school and we had timed math quizzes. They were made to be like a game where if you did one really well you move up from addition to subtraction and so on. Well I have always been bad at math and the quizzes being timed didn't help.
 So I was very behind in the game while all the other kids were way ahead of me. Did my teacher think ""hey maybe I should talk to this child's parents about getting her into some special math classes to help or something?"" Nope her solution was to pull me out of class and just yell at me in the hallway. She said something along the lines ""this is unacceptable. All the other kids are way ahead so be better."" And I cried my eyes out. I never told my parents cause I thought I was to blame. I'm now a 20 year old in college and that teacher is still teaching in my hometown."
Abusive 1st grade teacher,"When I was 6 years old I had a 1st grade teacher that was the worst she played favorites ignored students with learning issues (disability, language barriers, etc etc). She sent students to time out for even minor issues such as coming back eating lunch at home through wrong entrance. In fact she kept one my classmates in timeout for so long they peed themselves in front of the class because that was her favorite spot to put students in timeout."
Professor Told Me to Drop Out of My Major,"Here is some background. I'm a music education major and I play the oboe. Currently enrolled at a school in San Diego. This happened when I was at a city college. My band director made me feel like shit, but my orchestra director saved me.

I have always been insecure about my playing. I started playing oboe back in 2014, my junior year of as HS. Which is pretty late for someone to start on oboe. I was bullied quite a bit for it I  high school. When I got to college I was more accepted and quickly got better because my private teacher inspired me to do better. 

My band director (BD) was pretty chill, but I got vibes from him I didn't like. He was nice to me, but I noticed he had favorites. The few people I hung out with aren't on that list, so we were all insecure because of it. I would say I'm the better musician of the group, but they're also great musicians and we encourage each other. 

My fourth semester we were playing some more complicated music. One was El Comino Real, by Alfred Reed. There is a big oboe solo on it and I sounded good on it. The day of the concert I played 1 wrong note, but you couldn't tell. My teacher didn't think I was good enough, so the next 2 concerts we had he hired people to play my part. The 1st of those two concerts my teacher brought in a guy was amazing at oboe and had been playing for much longer than I have. It made me really insecure that he paid someone to play a part that HIS STUDENT is supposed to play. It was cool playing with the other guy, but I was nowhere as good as him and i compared myself a lot during that concert. The next concert he brought in another girl to play that part. He didn't tell me this until a week before the concert. BD allowed me to play the solo in class and had me thinking was going to get to play it. The day of the concert I meet the girl during our rehearsal. She was playing it wrong and messed it up during the concert. I wasn't mad at her at all. I was pissed and upset with BD. I was hurt that he had no faith in me. Everyone told me I should have played the solo and not hurt. You're supposed to show case the hard work of your students not the people you paid to play.  From that day on BD was dead to me and I was no longer inspired by him. 

My fifth semester rolls around and we got another oboist. He had been playing longer than me and he is older than me. He was good and we're both on the same level. I put more work into my playing and music than him, but for some reason BD only focused on him. 

Around this time I was hit with depression and anxiety. A lot of my confidence depleted and was non existent. I constantly made dark jokes about my playing. Then one day when I was supposed to perform for class I had a really bad break down the night before. I emailed BD and he said to go see him before class. That day I was mentally exhausted and felt sensitive still. I didn't want to do anything. I didn't want to be anywhere. I went to see BD and he asked what was going. I told him about the stress I've accumulated and about a broken heart. When I looked at his face he was so stern. He honestly looked like he didn't care about anything I said. The next thing he said to me broke me in to a million tiny pieces that would be hard to be put back together. 

BD: Sound like to me you don't have what it takes to be a music major.

As soon as he said that my eyes widened with sadness. I wanted to cry but I held it in. I didn't want to show anymore weakness.

BD: You should just quit and figure something else to do. If you can't handle your classes then quit. If it's too much for you then drop out. Clearly you don't have what it takes.

My heart sunk and felt like a nuclear bomb was dropped on it. I couldn't believe what just happened. I walked out of his office and closed the door. Tear began to slowly drop down my face. I walked out the building to leave. When I saw my two closes friends. I cried and let it all out. I tried to explain what had happened, but I kept crying and kept getting worse. They told me not to go home because it'll only show more weakness. 

After class the three of us went to my house. We sat in my living room and talked about everything. Talking to them made me realize that BD was wrong and I have the capabilities to become a music major.  

The following monday I talked to my orchestra director  about a solo I was playing in a concert and he said I sounded great. Something BD never told me. Of course he gave me some criticism, but he helped me spark up some confidence. When we had concerts for orchestra I got to stand up to receive recognition for the solos I played. It took 5 semesters  and I FINALLY got to stand up and be recognized and applauded for my playing. Again something BD never did. 

 That semester he inspired me to be the best oboist I can be. I told him about my problems with some classes and he gave me advice to help me pass those classes. My sixth semester I was getting acceptance letters to schools I've wanted to go to. I am currently going to my dream school on a scholarship and have proven to BD that music is my goal and I am right where I belong."
Funny,

Teacher is rehired after being fired years prior.,"The choir middle/high school teacher at my school was fired years ago and was just recently rehired after the previous choir teacher quit because of the school’s lack of accommodation toward’s her schedule. In mine and, to my knowledge, many other’s opinions she shouldn’t have been rehired in the first place if she was FIRED; which I assume means she did something bad or was simply bad at teaching. My assumption now, after observations, is because she was a horrid teacher. I don’t personally take her class as I don’t enjoy choir, but a few of my friends do and they constantly tell me that they skip her class until they can officially dropout of it. Other classmates, and my friends, have also said very openly that she barely allows them to sing at all and that she refuses to take any constructive criticism as she hasn’t taught older children for a LONG time.

I can testify that the “no singing” part is true as our recent Veteran’s Day choir concert the only person I could her was the teacher. You could tell the children were singing, however, we’re very off key and didn’t quite know all the lyrics. The teacher is still in her first year being with us, but many people have advised the board NOT to give her a tenure as many people were already dropping out of her class as soon as they can.

I do believe she is trying her hardest to try and fit in and do her best as a new-ish high school and middle school teacher, so I hope she’s able find her feet here and become a great teacher that many students will be able to express themselves and their group through their songs."
Accelerated ELA 10 teacher has blatant favorites and a blatant undesirable no. 1. You know who the undesirable is.,"So. For context, I have difficulty in school. My academic potential is pretty good, and I pick up on new concepts fast. But I still manage to end up flailing my arms around trying to get to a C before the marking period ends. So, we tried to have accommodations set up to help me (my state has a law that if a student is shown to be capable but is not performing as expected, they can receive accommodations to get them to that potential). All of my teachers were sent questionnaires to ask what they thought of me. My AP US History teacher sends, I kid you not, answers that could win an award. I mean, each paragraph had a three-part thesis with supporting evidence to boot.

But my ELA teacher? here's what her paper looked like. And these papers are issued by the state, by the way.

* What is this students general behavior like?

>Fine

* Does the student seem depressed or otherwise ill?

>No

* Any other issues you'd like to address?

>Hygiene issues

I take several issues with these answers. First, she didn't even seem to care. Her answers felt more like evasion rather than response.

Second, Hygiene issues? I took gym as a seventh hour just so that the classes i go to aren't smelling like shit. I shower for a half hour every day! I don't have hygiene issues!

Third, she's an English teacher. And she didn't even answer in complete sentences.

I asked her about all of this on Tuesday. She says that my hygiene issues are because i'm picking my nose. I'm scratching the outside of my nose! My skin gets dry as all hell during the winter, so i'm going to be scratching my nose!

This is where the shit hits the fan.

She goes on the mother of all power trips. 

* She says that she's the teacher and i'm the student, and it's not my job to heckle her on what she does (there isn't anything there to be heckled)
* She says that as a teacher, she has to do a lot of paperwork every day. This is not an acceptable excuse. I see her looking at goddamn Athleta or Under Armor websites EVERY FUCKING DAY
* She has time to go into the school's weight room for an HOUR every day after school. I know this because I see her leaving the weight room as I'm going back to the locker rooms after my 7th hour.
* She pulls her age card. ""I'm a teacher, you're a student. I'm older than you. we can argue about this once you have a college degree."" I hope she dies before I get my college degree.

I really don't like wishing death on people, but this teacher is just so infuriating to deal with. She's the only Acc ELA 10 teacher in the school, meaning that I have to deal with her next semester too. And I feel like she does this because she knows she intimidates us. She is extremely muscular, and she knows damn well that she can beat the shit out of all of us with one hand behind her back if she wanted to.

I'm getting anxiety because of her."
Terrible teachers,"I’m a long time lurker and this is my first post, and I’m on mobile, so... ya.

I go to a charter school that’s really small, so there’s not many problems, but there’s three teachers I have a beef with. One of them technically isn’t a teacher, but she’s close enough. Also, I’d consider myself the class clown, and I’m pretty confident.

Story one: 
Because I go to a charter school I take Latin. Useless, right?! It’s definitely going to be usable in real life.*heavy sarcasm intended* 
So, it was after math, and me and my friend headed over to the Latin room. We went in. Keep in mind, we are still on break technically, but we just got in early. The teacher, who we’ll name, mrs. c, was in the room. I was  joking around with my friend, and I said...

Me: don’t you sass me like that! *jokingly*

Her: Excuse meee!

Me: what?

Her: don’t eeeuuuuuseaahhhh that language in my class

Me: what language?

Her: you know what language

Me:ok.

At this point, I was pretty confused, and I was talking to my friends about it. Here comes... the climax. I scooted out of my desk on my chair, when my knee scraped HARD on a bolt on the underside of the desk, and I expressed the pain with a very audible “OW!” And this triggers a rant from my teacher

I wasn’t really listening, but I mostly heard
“Stop stealing attention from me” and “you’re not really hurt! Stop faking for attention,” meanwhile I’m bleeding pretty bad and in pain. 

Story 2: 

Here’s the main event. This idiot teacher, who we’ll call mrs. Ann, is the PE teacher who also watches everyone at break and lunch. There’s tons of annoying things she did (or didn’t do), like the kids a grade younger than me threw a basketball AT MY EYE, and she saw, and did nothing. But when I threw a dodgeball at them, she made me sit out at the tables for 30 minutes. But the main story is this:

This happened at lunch. It was fun and all,  but when lunch ended, she blew the whistle right in my face. My ears were ringing and my head hurt. And then, as if to rub it in, she blew it again in my face, and told me to clean up my trash, and pointed to a table about 10 yards away(I say yards because I play football and I’m used to saying yards) from where I sat. I had math after, which was horrible, because both my ears were still ringing, and so I couldn’t hear anything. 

So yeah, that’s it. And a fun fact, mrs.ann when I was in 6th grade mocked my friend. P

Please tell me if this doesn’t belong in this sub. Also I’m going to post this on the bad teachers sub, but I can’t remember the name of it. Could you tell me in the comments?"
Drama teacher constantly picked her favorites when it came to casting.,"So here's a story that I really shouldn't be mad about still, considering this all happened in middle school. (yikes, I'm in my junior year of high school...) In 6th grade, I was so excited that my new school offered a theater class. I had always been into performing in front of people since I was little. I stepped into class the very first day, and I loved it! The teacher, who we will call Ms. Jones, (not her real name, I'm terrified of confrontation so we don't have to worry about her finding out :/ ) was so nice, and considerate to those who had stage fright. A month or two later, she announced that she was putting on a musical, and I was absolutely ecstatic. I went straight home and started practicing my audition.

After my audition, Ms. Jones said I did really well, and she said she was considering me for one of the leads. I was asked to show up to call-backs the next day. I practiced and practiced my solo that night. I wanted that role so bad.

When the cast list came out I was just about the first person there. I scanned down all of the names and I saw that I not only didn't get the role that I wanted, I didn't get into the play at all. Not even the ensemble. (the people that are just in the background, filling the stage.) My little 11 year old heart dropped. I wished she hadn't gotten my hopes up.

The spring musical rolled around near the end of school, and I tried again. She told me the same thing that she did during my last audition. I went to call-backs again. Same thing happened again. But I was persistent. I thought that if I kept trying out then she would eventually pick me for something. Sometime in 7th grade, I began to realize that the same people were being casted for the leads every single year. I even tried to make friends with them, to see if she would consider me then. Of course, she didn't.

I wasn't the only kid being picked on, I met this other girl (we will call her Ruby) who was going through the same thing. We shared stories and I decided to talk to Ms. Jones and find out what went wrong with all of my auditions. She had nothing to say really, just that ""she changed her mind and thought the other person would be better."" Real encouraging, right? Ms. Jones could have at least told me what I could be improving. But I guess not. I happened to talk to my mother about the situation and she insisted to go talk to Ms. Jones. I let her. All of a sudden, the next play, I was put in the ensemble. Coincidence? I think not. My mom is a sweetheart with the softest soul, she would never threaten Ms. Jones or anything. I just don't see why she decided to let me participate, after all those times i had been turned down. 

Ever since then I've doubted myself, and I've been too scared to try out for anything to this day. My current chorus teacher always asks me if I want to do one of the solos, and I've turned her down every single time. I guess I just don't want to be disappointed again. Honestly, what Ms. Jones put me and so many other kids through was in no way fair. It's a middle school play. It's nowhere close to Broadway, honey. My advice to her is to let some other kids have a freakin' chance. Don't give them hope just to rip it from them a week later."
"6th grade teacher says ""You either keep on writing or give up""","Ok this is a short story to tell irl but I will try and extend the story just a smidgen for no reason.


Cast: Op= Me C= Classmate BT= Bad teacher


Little bit of a backstory; So in 6th grade BT assigned a 5 paragraph essay for an interview of what your occupation you chose will be when you grow up, I chose a lawyer. Writing the essay was classwork but incomplete stuff had to be finished on the weekend. The problem was that I forgot to do the interview questions so it was incomplete so did C and a few other students. BT was going on about and asking classmates 
""Hey blank how do you feel that you don't get to start the essay because your peers didn't finish their work"" 
Other Classmate replied: ""I don't care"" 
BT went on saying that ""Well maybe you don't care but other kids feel frustrated""
Istg this lady had the audacity to talk crap about her ""failing students"" I'm front of their faces. I was having a mental breakdown because of the smiley face incomplete stamp and the fact I was one of the students who didn't finish the interview questions and i won't be able to write a like 5 paragraphs. Ok so I was procrastinating because I was the 11 year old that doesn't want to spend the weekend doing ""homework"" for the interview questions or the essay. I did finish the essay early but C who sits next to me wanted to be an artist and he didn't get enough info to even write like idk 2 paragraphs

C asks for some help around the table and I as a little bit of an artist myself, well more of a colouring and sketching type more than the painting type, gave a little intel but it kinda wasn't enough so he went to BT. Conversation went like this;

C: *raises hand* ""Hey BT?""

BT: ""Yes C?""

C: ""I don't have enough information for my essay and I can't extend it""

BT: ""Well either keep writing or give up""


Yes she said it she told an 11 year old to either keep trying or give up. Like c'mon man he's just asking for advice. C starts crying and all I could do was pat him on the back as I am not good with interactions with emotional peers so all I do is just back pats and I say ""it's ok"" I couldn't hug him because in 6th grade

You hug a person opposite or not opposite of your gender (mostly if you're a girl and you hug a guy) and some popular ass girl sees it, now you have a boyfriend/girlfriend because you can't convince anyone it isn't unless you have a reason like they are siblings or smth like that. Also I had a little crush on him and I didn't want anyone to find out. (._.) Now the internet knows


Ok back to the story


BT goes and helps C as he's crying and she says ""it was a rhetorical question"" and he some how gets the little information into an essay.



Lesson learned for people out there

Teachers don't be a hypocrite

Students finish your homework.




Ok I'm just gonna go ahead and say 
""SHE HAD POSITIVE POSTERS ALL OVER THE DAMN ROOM""


The end, have a nice day."
i saw this on my test,
"Art teacher tells me to go back a grade, I progress to state level in art comp","To start this off I have to explain how art levels work in my school system. Art 1 is the first year of art credit in high school, after this you can progress to advanced art classes like painting, drawing, printmaking, etc...

Well my middle school gave the option to 8th graders interested in art to take Art 1 for high school credit. I've always loved art and have been told I have a talent for it, so naturally I took that class, which meant I could take advanced art classes freshman year of hs, while most students had to take art 1 freshman year. Not knowing any better, I chose to take drawing, because at the time that's the kind of art I was into. For this story we will refer to the teacher as bob. 

Bob was an older man whose classroom had entirely while, barren walls, which is odd for an art class. He started the first day with a lecture that lasted the class period (1hr and 30min), where at one point he explained how he invented a type of graphite shading (which turned out to be a really basic and common type of shading). He then proceeded to give us assignments which were basically ""copy this stock photo I printed perfectly in pencil"". Our first project was colored pencil  only, which happens to be the medium I dislike most. I was really into ink, and the different shadings that could be done with it, but nope, colored pencil only. On multiple occasions I've seen him actually erase and re-draw parts of students work when they brought it up to him for advice (which if you're an artist know is basically a crime), and at one point referred to a female classmate as ""babygirl"". He never gave instruction in class and literally sat at his desk the whole time without saying a word while we worked in silence. The few times I brought my project up to him for some constructive criticism/advice for how to improve, Bob would somehow turn it into a rant about how ""see? this is why little inexperienced kids shouldn't get into drawing. it's very advanced and someone like you should be in art 1"". 

Eventually through a lucky sequence of events I was able to make a piece of art in a medium I enjoyed and had it entered into a pretty big art competition in my state. I didn't expect much out of it but it actually progressed to state level and got perfect marks on both state and regional level. 

His behavior towards me at the state competition basically solidified what an ass Bob was for me. Students were gathering after the art show, collecting their art, medals and judge sheets, where they could read what was said about their piece. This was very exciting for everyone involved as not many get to go to state level. People were taking pictures with their medals, art pieces, etc. Except mine was no where to be found. When I asked Bob where my piece and judge sheet were he disinterestedly said they were in his truck, he would give them to me at school on monday. After asking again if I could have them now he finally went to retrieve them from his truck, making a whole show about how inconvenient it was for him and how entitled I was being. Yeah? Entitled to the same treatment as the other kids? This was a rare thing for me to get to do, just like everyone else. It was an important moment for me and my confidence as an artist and I just find it gross that his spite and selfishness tried to ruin it for me."
Still bothers me 30 years later,"So when I was in second grade I was a kinda hyper kid - never got in trouble , did my homework , but a little hyper.  My teacher that year didn’t like me , my parents have told me as an adult that they thought he was a complete asshole and apparently he had that reputation among the parents in the school. 

Any way - I didn’t like my bus driver that year . I stuck my tongue out at him as I was walking away from the bus one day.

The next day he hands me a bus ticket - he says I Stuck my middle finger up at him and my parents have to take me to see the principle before I am allowed to ride the bus again.   Obviously no one believed me that I didn’t do it. I was grounded for weeks. And for the record , I swear i didn’t flick him off.

A few months later   ....

We had been doing this thing during math time in class where If you got a problem right you got a little piece of paper. There was a jar of jelly beans  that every time you got a piece of paper , you got to write a guess on it of how many jelly beans were in the jar. Whoever guessed closest without going over would win the jelly beans and if there was a tie - the kids who both guessed the same would  split the jar.

So my favorite athlete was Wayne Gretzky , he wore #99. So every time I got a guess I did a 99 - 99, 199, 299 , 399, etc. specially remember having guessed 399. 

So when the time comes and they reveal the winner, which was not me - teacher says there was 399 jelly beans , and no one guessed it exact so the it went to person who guess closest. So I walk up to him a few minutes later and say I guessed 399 - he looks me dead in the face and says “ no you didn’t,” and looks back down at his desk.  Again, obviously   no one believed me.

I don’t blame my parents or other teachers for not believing me - no one is gonna believe an kid over an adult, and no one is gonna actually think an adult would pull shit like that. 

But man , both of these things were pretty shitty as a little kid , I remember being so frustrated and just not understanding why they happened.

That was 30 years ago - as an almost 40 year old man I still can not fathom what kind of asshole you gotta be to fuck some little kid over."
Music teacher from a 1st grade hell,"Ok so I’ve held onto this story for YEARS and I’m currently 16  and a sophomore in high school however at this time I was in 5th grade and I was about 10. I went to the local public school in my town and in my 5th grade year we got a new music teacher. (at this time music class was necessary thing I guess) Anyway the music teacher was originally a 1st grade teacher and her husband happened to be the FREAKING PRINCIPAL so when she became the music teacher we all were screwed.

Cast:

Me/OP

Mrs.Crap - the music teacher

rando students - just random kids in my class

Ok let’s begin so in 5th grade we found out our other beloved music teacher had retired and we got Mrs. crap and as soon as we walked into the music room  dear god I knew it was game over we were going to all have to suffer.  The room was decked out in bright colors everything 1st grade mode, now quickly note that at each end of the room were 2 chairs you would find in a 1st grade room, really tiny chairs.  So anyway i remember only a few individual moments and each sucked so much, as kids we couldn’t do anything I mean who believes 5th graders?

Story 1:(kinda)
So those chairs at the ends of the rooms were TIME OUT CHAIRS!!!!!! Like are you kidding me we are in 5th grade, just send us to your husband. any way one kid was being loud and she sent him to time out and he messed around more. It was funny she got soooo mad.  

Story 2:
One day Mrs.Crap was teaching us something idk what and 2 girls were whispering to each other because WERE CHILDREN and she warned them to stop talking, anyway a few mins goes by and they start talking again so Mrs. Crap stands up and goes to the girls and GRABS ONE OF THEIR ARMS AND PRACTICALLY DRAGS HER TO A SPOT NEXT TO HER. I later talked to the girl the next day and she said she was fine but still had a RED MARK on her arm. I told my mom and she told me that if I ever had issues like that with her I was to remove her arm and call her to come get me.

Story 3:
So she always played the DUMBEST music ever again she was a 1st grade teacher at one point. Me and my friends were sick and tired of her crap so we only kinda participated,I remember  the song was about recycling and she told us we had to do the dance moves with the song and me and my friends were slacks, mean while the boys were being dumb and laughing about it. She paused the video at one point and said “anyone who doesn’t want to participate anymore please sit down.” In the most condescending voice ever. Me and my friends dropped like sacks of potatoes, she was ready mad about it and just continues to play the  song.  She played it for another like 45 secs then paused the music to say “anyone who doesn’t want to be a fuddy duddy anymore you may join again.” One person stood up cause she was worried about getting in trouble and the rest of us just chilled. She then told us that if we didn’t participate we would have to stay after class. So we all slowly stood up and she continued the music only for us to be super boring and slacking in dance omg.

Story 4:
So we all had a concert we had to be a part of now I was in band and that night the band was suppose to play and then the choir was to sing. It was a requirement, a part of our grade so again we were screwed. The music was horrible and we were even embarrassed to sing any part of it. So after I played with the band we had to cross back through one of the music rooms to the band room. Band students were told to leave our instruments and head to the choir room to get ready. Well Mrs. crap saw me and told me and others to hurry up putting our things away. So we headed into the band room and I packed up my clarinet and bolted out the back door of the band room. I had told my mom before hand to meet me in the back so we could leave early, she knew I hated my teacher and the music so she was ok with not having to deal with me complaining.  so we bolted outside, I remember it raining and my mom laughed when we got in the car saying even if I wanted to go back and sing I couldn’t because my hair was ruined. I thought I was so smart and I was because she gave me an A for the concert.
I’m glad I got an A for sneaking out of if crap concert.   Lol
Thanks for reading it’s been fun!
Also am I being annoying or is she as bad as I think she is?"
Tried to fail me on my final for having surgery on my midterm.,"So in college I had a teacher who I didn  not get along with. I had to have surgury the day of our midterm and brought her in the information with the type of surgury blacked out as it was none of her business what I was getting done. She throws a fit about how it's the day of the midterm and I need yo reschedule the surgury.
In Ontario Canada that is not possible (she has lived her for a while and knows this) you get told when and where to be for all surgeries. There are 2 sections to that class and I asked to wright with the other section the day before my surgury so I wouldn't be stressing about it while recovering. She denies my request. I write the midterm and I get an ok grade.
After that she treated me like an idiot for the remainder of the semester. Fast forward to the final test. It is open book  and done at home. I get extra time to do test due to a nonvisible disability so I go through the text and make sure I have every question done correctly. I get my grade and somehow I failed the test.
Panicked I reach out to my teacher who refuse to talk to me about the grade. I contact the student union and they give me the info on how to appeal  my grade which I do.
I go in and talk to the DEAN OF MY PROGRAM who looks at what I had on my test and companies it to the text. I tell her about the issues i had for my midterm and how my teacher was rude about my surgury. She sees the answers I put down are right but I have a 0 grade on alot of them.
Dean says she will deal with it and contact me latter. I get an email the next day saying my grade has been changed and that the teacher has been placed on a development plan to ensure this doesn't happen again.
Had the teacher again the next year and boy did she treat me with kid gloves. I got good grades in her class but her test format changed to all multiple choice so she couldn't effect my grades with her personal views on who wrote the test."
My Horrible College professor,"Hey so I currently attend my local community college, and my teacher is just the worst. It's not that he's a mean guy or anything like that, he just doesn't teach. I love working with computers, I remember starting this as a hobby when I was around 8. I found out that I could make a decent living with this around the start of my Sr. year of high school. The first year of classes. I have to say I learned a lot and did well in my classes. I also decided I want to be a coder and programmer ( I tell computers what to do). This fall I started with my higher end class, but I really haven't learned anything. My teacher at one point cancelled so many classes that at one point out of 6 weeks where I was suppose to have it 3 times a week, I only had 3 classes in total. Like I said I started this as a hobby around 8. I mainly played around with coding. I was aware of theories and the points of codes, because I used to study that in my free time as a kid, but now I just needed to learn codes and programming languages. My teacher has barley taught me any new codes I already didn't know. He's adding more classes next semester and I am on the verge of not taking them, and found an online course that will give me what I need to learn. I'm just sick of what my teacher has done."
"Teacher enforces collective punishment which I cannot medically do, then proceeds to ignore me when I tell her.","This is when I was in 9th grade. My English teacher at the time was a lady who seemed sweet at first, but eventually it became clear that she did not enjoy teaching or being around kids. She did minimal work and almost seemed to take joy in our confusion/struggling. At one point in the year she decided it would be a great idea to enforce collective punishment on the class in the form of …push ups. If anyone talked? Push ups. If anyone got a question wrong? Push ups. You get the idea.

Now, I have an issue with my left arm/wrist where one of the bones in my forearm is too short and this puts extra strain on the muscles in my arm and wrist. This makes activity such as push ups incredibly painful after like 5 of them. Because of this I have a medical note explaining I cannot do weight bearing activities with my left arm. However, I never presented this to her as I did not expect to be doing push ups in English class.

I attempted to do as told and do the push ups. Each time a student got in trouble the class would have to do 5 push ups. After the 2nd set of push ups I was in a fair amount of pain so I went to the teacher in the back of the class to quietly ask if I could do something else like sit ups due to my wrist. Instead of responding to me, she turns to the class and loudly announces ""Class we have a student trying to get out of the push ups, that's 5 more for everyone!"" At this point I am both petrified and pissed. I had a fair amount of social anxiety back then so having the whole class stare at me in annoyance made me start to cry.  I tried to do sit ups instead the next time around but she told me I would go to the principal if I didn't do the push ups. This led to me trying and failing to do push ups the rest of class while it felt like my arm was on fire.

When I got home I asked my mother for a copy of my x-ray and my doctor's note. I took them into class the next day and presented them to her while explaining why I couldn't do the push ups. She at first looks mortified but regains her composure and says ""Yeah, whatever go to your desk. You can do sit ups instead."" I'm honestly glad it resolved the way it did, but the whole situation just seemed ridiculous to me.

I had several other incidents with this teacher through the remainder of the school year, which I may get around to posting. At the end of the year she realized teaching was not for her and went back to school herself."
Vice Principal BELITTLES Sexual Harassment Victim (Pretty Long Story),"Okay, so, before I get into this, I regret nothing and am proud of myself for my last action towards the focal point of this story. 

On to the chaos of Southern education!

So, there was this sophomore running around my high school for a while now who we will call Louis. Louis was apparently an autistic, ADHD-riddled boy who went around doing ... questionable things. Upon my arrival to this school 4.5 months ago, I did not know this and saw him as an enthralling character. We would spend every second we could together, and the Friday of the first week of school we were dating. I should have seen the red flags, honestly; he would get red whenever I talked to any of my other guy friends (of which I have many \[Jonathan, if you're seeing this, I absolutely adore you\]); he would make weird comments (I brought out a deck of cards one time and he proceeded to ask, dead serious, if we could gamble for my body. I played it off as a sort of ""Shit, we're going to sell me on the black market?""); he would always refuse to get up if I didn't kiss him... But I was stupid and thought I loved him. 

About two weeks into that, another really nice sophomore who we will call Erin told me about this guy's past that he neglected to tell me.

He is a sex offender. Not registered, but definitely going down that path. He's apparently harassed upwards of 6 girls. Naturally, after learning this, I was angry and decided to pull the ""I'm mad at you but I won't say anything about it for your sake"" card. 

After another week of that, I was told by a junior to break up with him. So, I did. I made sure I went out with a bang. So, when the time came for me to see him again, I walked off, borrowed my friend's D&D Player's Handbook, and whacked him in the back of the head, and walked off again. I am still very proud of that. He deserved it. Like, a lot. 

I got summoned to the principal's office the next day after a few hours of me crying a bunch. I was threatened with a day of in-school suspension until Louis came in and said, ""No, don't do that."" And so, they didn't. I was let off with no punishment.

Until I got home.

My parents told me I would suffer minimal punishment because they've already taken away everything they can (phone, computer, etc.). I shouldn't even be on my computer right now,  much less have this account! Anyways, they did what they could and it had no bearing on my life except for the part where I was no longer up-to-date on my favorite shows.

A week after I hit him, I told him I never wanted to see his sorry face or hear his voice again. He obliged and I saw none of him for a week.

Louis was taken out of the school in handcuffs one day when a girl called (I assume) our non-emergency police number. It was glorious to hear that rumor.

Two days later, he was back. I got a firsthand account of how my friend and a group of her own went to a different assistant principal's office (Fuck you, Dr. Quinn. You look like Colonel Sanders without the apron and goatee) and gave him an earful about this literal felon walking around. Direct quote: ""If it were anybody else, he would have been expelled last year!"" One of the girls in my friend's group (we will call her Dodge) happened to be a victim of Louis. 

Dr. Quinn started to belittle her. He said something along the lines of, ""I know the law better than you. I was there when it was written!"" And then, he had the audacity to start talking about *me* and said, ""Besides, we already had one student whack him in the head with a book. That's not how you do things.""

Dodge said, ""That's right, sir, it isn't."" He gave her a nod, and she went on, ""It should have been in the face."" It was all she could do not to laugh while he gave her the most hateful stare known to that school. Dodge even said to me that she didn't know how any of the staff wasn't fired for this.

I don't know what happened after that. What I do know is that this week, I learned Louis was expelled, hopefully in part to Dodge and her vicious-but-necessary telling-off of the assistant principal. I also learned that people really, really like me for hitting the guy in the head."
History teacher talked to a student in an unacceptable manner and then lied about it to parents,"I'm a 15-year-old girl and I attend grammar school. We weren't in a normal classroom. We were in a small classroom with a huge table in the middle. We sat around it. We had a history class and the teacher asked if anyone forgot their homework. Most people raised their hands. The teacher got mad and told us that this school isn't a place to behave like this and to transfer school or work. This is pretty common in our school (and in most grammar schools) but I don't like it and a parent had already complained about it in the Google+ group before this incident. She got even angrier because she thought that one girl shrugged but she continued. After about five minutes the teacher yelled at the same girl. 
She said that she would ""kick her the fuck out if she dares to turn to her again."" No one understood what she meant. The girl asked her who she wasn't supposed to turn to. The teacher yelled the thing multiple times again. The girl told her she didn't understand why she was getting yelled at. She started to mock the girl by repeating what she (the girl) said, in a high-pitched voice (It isn't the first time this had happened and she only does this to girls which are kinda sexist. and told her she was good at acting.
 After that, another teacher came in asked for our teacher's assistance. She stepped out of the classroom, and the girl started crying. Around three minutes later she came back and saw that the girl was crying. She told her that. This was an s a sign of weakness and that her anger was justified (in an angry tone). She told her to wash her face and go home, but she told her she didn't want to. The teacher said she had to and that she didn't want her here. (still in a very angry tone).
The girl left the classroom and came back after 15 minutes. The teacher kept on mocking her a few times during the class. She said used her as a warning: she told us we would end up like the girl. She bragged to another teacher about putting a disrespectful kid to her place.
After class ended we all went home and told our parents about what happened. The parents have a google+ group to communicate with the teacher and other parents. 4 parents (including the girl's mom) sent the teacher an email about how they found her behavior unacceptable.
Today, the girl's mom posted the response of the teacher in the group. The teacher brought up previous small incidents with the girl (she even brought up one that happened after this incident.) these were things like not paying attention and talking in class.) she lied about what happened. In her version of the story, she was polite and she told the girl exactly what she did wrong. She said that after she came back the girl was still being disrespectful (she was crying) and that's when she told her to she, would kick her the fuck out, and that's when she started crying. She said that she ""offered"" to let her home and didn't send her away. The email was full of mean comments. For example, every time after she told the girls mom about her ""bad"" behavior she asked her ""did your daughter tell you this too?""
 Her mother, unfortunately, believed her and said that she hoped this wouldn't happen again.
I want to show this to my classmates as they can't see this because it's in the parent's group. all the girl's mom told her is that the teacher ""apologized"". I could see it because my mom showed me but she said I couldn't tell anyone."
Take and peat are uncommonly used verbs but my sons teacher belongs here for failing English!,
Is it Okay for Teachers to Embarrass Students for Knowing the Right Answers?,"Okay, so I’m a high school freshman, and today in my geometry class I had a realization. A girl who sits next to me in my class (We can call her Alexa) was on a bit of an answer streak: she answered probably 3 or so questions in a row over a 20 minute period. Nobody else was raising their hands. The teacher asked another question, and Alexa raised her hand again. Our teacher looked at her, and ignored her. She put her hand down again as he kept looking around the room. He said “anyone?” And I looked at Alexa and she had put her hand back up. My teacher looked at her, acted annoyed, and said “Anyone except for Alexa?” I could tell she was super embarrassed. I understand that he wanted others to participate, but I was thinking he could have done it in a way that complimented her, like “Is Alexa really the only one who knows the answer?” I’ve had a couple of teachers do that to me before, and I always felt more pride than embarrassment. Adding onto that, I some other kids started making fun of her for being a “teachers pet/know-it-all”. Alexa is super nice and down to earth, but she can be kind of sensitive, so I’m wondering what other people’s thoughts are? Thanks!


TLDR: teacher says “anyone except for *student who has answered several questions right in a row*?” And she gets upset. Thoughts?"
Worst Teachers of My Life Post 2: Mr. Handsy The Teacher That Wasn't My Teacher,"This second story of mine is about Mr. Handsy a man that wasn't my teacher but someone that who took over for my second-grade teacher for a while while she was at home recovering from eye surgery. 

Now to be clear my second-grade teacher Mrs. Terrific was one of the best teachers I have ever had. She was and still is a very kind, caring, loving woman who I am still in contact with to this day. I just wanted to make that clear because Mrs. Terrific wasn't the bad teacher Mr. Handsy was.

So like I said before Mrs. Terrific wasn't in school for a while since she was recovering from eye surgery. This means that me and my class had a subsite as most people do when their teacher is out sick.

This substitute was a man named Mr. Handsy who was one of those people that enjoyed seeing kids cried and enjoyed yelling at us as loud as he possibly could. While Mr. Handsy was there my class and I had no brakes besides lunch and recess. With recess, he would cut it short and force us to go back inside to sit in silence and work. 

He would call us stupid when we asked questions and when we would get the answers wrong because he wouldn't help us he would call us stupid.

All in all, he was just a miserable, miserable person who really shouldn't have been teaching and even now I wonder why he was allowed to teach.

Anyway onto the story, so this happened a week before Mrs. Terrific was meant to come back. It happened near the end of the day when we were all lining up to go home. Mr. Handsy was busy yelling at us to get in line and because of this, we were all starting to get upset because what six to seven-year-old wouldn't cry with a grown man yelling at them about how stupid and useless they are for no good reason.

Anyway, I was one of the last to pack up because I couldn't find where I had put my workbook which had my homework in it. This lead Mr. Handsy to yell at me more than the others which of course, caused me to start crying because I was a little girl.

Now, this is where his name Mr. Handsy comes into play, see Mr. Handsy didn't like that I was taking so long and that I was now crying which slowed me down. So he came over to me grabbed my arm in a hard grip and jerked me roughly towards the line before shoving me into the line and telling me to shut up. He grabbed my backpack and threw it at my feet before walking to the head of the line so he could let us leave when the bell ring.

When I got home I cried to my mom and told her what had happened which made her angry and she called the school they said they couldn't do anything because there wasn't any proof. The next morning I wake up and I have a big bruise from where he had grabbed me which angered my mom even more. This caused her to take me up to the school to show them what had happened and they told her that, that wasn't proof because I couldn't have gotten that from anywhere.

This is when my mom had, had enough she had watched me come home crying and upset every day because of Mr. Handsy but when she had called about it they were told they couldn't do anything and now that this teacher had hurt a student but hurt me she had, had enough.

She told my principal that she would go to the police about this because clearly this man didn't need to be around children before leaving with me. My mom did call the police but I don't know what came of it since I didn't go back to school until Mrs. Terrific was back.

So Mr. Handsy was an abusive asshole who shouldn't have been allowed to teach and because of this me and many others had to pay the price because my school didn't want to do shit about.

That's the entire story and just like before if you're one of those people that justifies or tries to take up for teachers like this. Don't comment or say anything because you're wrong and you know it. Again I don't care if you think this is real or not, I'm doing this to vent and get it out of my system so I don't have to let it affect me anymore."
The migrainous music teacher,"I had a music teacher in 7th and 8th grade that was an all around weird person. I once saw her turn a corner by stopping, rotating 90 degrees in place, and then start moving again. Robotic doesn't begin to cover it. But the weirdest thing about her was that she suffered from severe migraine. And she somehow got a job as a music teacher. 

The migraine gave her sensitivity to loud noises. So we were usually not allowed to play any instruments or sing. Or really do anything music related. We had her class once a week. And one class every two months or so, she felt well enough that we actually got to do something music related.

She was also sick very often, which gave us a temp. The temp was great, and it was suggested to the school repeatedly that *he* should be the music teacher, rather than Mrs. Migraine. But nothing was done. The downside of him being just a temp is that he wasn't given access to the keys to the lockers were the instruments were kept. So when we had him as a teacher we *still* couldn't use instruments. Only Mrs. Migraine was allowed to have a key. 

To this day I still don't understand how she got her job. Or how she was allowed to keep her job, seeing as she was absent constantly because of migraines. I suffer from migraines too, they are a bitch. But if I start to miss well over 50% of my work days every month I wouldn't be surprised if my boss fired me. Or at least changed me to a part time worker. At the very least they could have given the temp a damn key to the instruments. 

And I would never expect to become a music teacher if I couldn't even handle the sound of someone playing an acoustic guitar without clutching my head and needing to leave the room."
Insane 3rd Grade Teacher,"I had a 3rd grade teacher, who was pretty unhinged. She was kind of physical, but never harmfully physical to me, atleast. She was normal, at first. She taught us, and it was okay. Things were pretty normal. Then, a few years later, when I was in 7th grade, I had learned, one of the students pissed her off. Her response to this, was to drag him down the f**king hall, and slap him. In return, if the family didn't say anything, they would force this teacher into retirement. Take this all in mind I got this from a secondary source, however her mother did work at the school. I waa bot half suprised, and half ""wow...ok...that happened"" about the situation. It was weird."
A-Hole Teacher,"Okay, this could be much worse, but hey f**k her, she was a horrible teacher. I had a shitty teacher tought both Social Studies, and religion, and she was an absolute bitch. She was physically abusive or anything, she was just very pissy.

Her main thing was to talk about her life, for hours on end, Then she would blame the class that she was behind, even though she couldn't shut the hell up.

I once told a sotry to my class about how a ""Homeless"" man wanted to mug me, my mother, and my aunt on a train. This bitch, defended the guy, who wanted to mug me.

The thing that pissed me off the most, was how she couldn't shut the f**k up about politics. Have politic veiws if you like, but you cant just say ""This candidate is horrible."" Infront of the class.

She once made a system were if you got a few tallys, The whole class eould get a suprise. If you lost them all, the whole class would get a punishment, f**king generic, I know. One day the class didnt feel like hearing her talk about how she once heard her daughter say something stupid. Because of this, she had the system of instead of a reward with the tallys, we just got a punishment, no freaking reward, for the rest of the God damn year.

This bitch couldn't hold it in, and I have many stories on her Jackassery, but if I told them all I'd likely be filling this entire section
TL;DR, asshole teacher, who loved being a bitch."
Evil French Teacher,"So im im in junior high, and ourschool has one French teacher for purpose of the story I will call her Ms.B for Bitch. This story happened to my brother's friend one day ms.b takes his phone while he was researching a project but she didn't know that he had an apple watch.so when she puts it in her desk he triggers an alarm on the phone and she was livid screaming stuff like ""where's theat noise"" and turn it the fuck off but he keeps turning it up slowly and that's the story. Ms.b is still a Huge bitch."
Ms. McAfee,"Ok so this teacher never got physical, but my god she was a bitch. She’d always be talking shit about the kids, and whenever a kid would screw up she’d always rub it in their faces and call them out for the whole class to hear. She also had zero patience for anyone and lashed out at even the most minor of things. Literally everyone who had her hated her guts."
My teacher made mg friend have a mental breakdown and I dread coming to her class daily.,"Sorry if this is horrible, speech wise. I'm exhausted and can barely focus. 

Let's jump into this. Some backstory, first. 
So this class is a math class (I think geometry? or algebra 2. I'm a highschool junior and my friend is a highschool freshman.) and we go to it at 4th period. When we are in her class, me and my friend (who will be called brand from now on) would be whispering about our work. Not loud at all, talking quietly about the problems we didn't understand, y'know. Normal class things. But the teacher would find some reason to yell and fuss at us, no matter what. 

The first thing that comes to mind is, of course 
'oh she must do this to everyone!'
'it sounds like a teacher disciplining her students, what's the big deal?' But the difference is. 
she doesn't do the same to the other students. other students would be up playing around and talking, throwing things across the room and yelling/cursing at other students. And she doesn't say a word to them. But the moment me and my friend says something, it's a s*itstorm. 

So that would go on for a while, along with other things she would say (things like ""There are gonna be a lot of failures this year."" and also allowing students to talk about t*tf*cking me, loudly, where the teacher was around.) for basically the entire time me and brand was in her class. And as you can guess, me and him got tired of it. 
We immediately went to the office (3 days ago, Friday. today is Monday.) and discussed it with our principals. We were told to type up a combination of everything that was told to us and what's going on on rather our phones or chromebook and send it to the principals. We did exactly that and sent away with the information about the teacher. 

The teacher was set up in a meeting with the principals. They discussed the things. The teacher, with this information that me and my friend was the one saying this information, decided that we were ""lying on her."" and began twisting our words around and saying that we has in the letter that she cursed us out, called us named (which she has, but we didn't include) and said she was gonna fail people, when in actuality we didn't say any of those things. it was extremely aggravating and upsetting, which made me breakdown in the middle of the hallway with a security guard helping me into the office. A bunch of students called us liars and other bad names. And the only reasons why we were called liars is because they didn't want her to get in trouble because that class period was pretty much the only period they can do whatever they want. 

So once my friend and I found out that information, I went directly to the office, my friend following suit but was later for other reasons. (Basically the teacher not allowing him into the class.) We talked to the principal, yet again, about her being petty and being unprofessional about bringing students into a situation that didn't involve them, pinning us to be  liars. We had no reason to lie on her at all, us both having 90s and above. But back on track. The Principal wrote down what we said and said she would talk to the teacher the last period. 

I'll update when something happens tomorrow and I'll be clarifying things as I go.

Edit 1: As I promised here is the update. 

let me start off to saying, today was the WORSE day of my entire life. When I walked into her class, I could see students looking at me and shaking their heads, smiling and snickering a bit. as soon as I sat down in my chair. A couple of minutes later a student (let's call him A) walked into the class, immediately taking notice of me and said ""I should smack you right now."" to which the teacher just smiled and gently held him back, telling him it's okay and let it go. 
upon this scene, a couple students laughed and looked at me, snickering. I was embarrassed by this, just turning red but again, I ignored it. as the lesson began, A and (for convenience,) J, began saying rude things like, ""Let her do the problems since you're failing us."" ""Let her do it since you can't teach."" and things like that, which also made me very upset, on the brink of tears.  what made me overflow with tears and cry, was the teacher basically encouraging this behavior. She would laugh and smile a bit, before saying some petty remark like, ""Since I don't teach.."" yada yada, ""don't worry about it, her 'lawyer' (the principal) is gonna help her. I ain't trying to have her 'lawyer' say anything to me."" and things like that. 

it made me so uncomfortable cry, which another student who wasn't apart of the bullying, ask if I was okay which I nodded my head now and put my head down. a couple students picked up on the fact that I was crying but they didn't care at all. 

My name was called over the intercom, being checked out which I was absolutely thrilled to go. J said ""She wasn't checked out!"" when another student alerted me about it. as I was leaving, Jasmine was talking to the teacher, saying ""That's what she gets from trying to get you fired!"" 


I have emailed my principal that I won't be attending school tomorrow because I wasn't feeling well (which is true) and if I could be moved out of her class. I'll update again when she replies and if anything happens."
Worst Teachers of My Life Post 1: Mrs. B The Banshee,"So sadly I have a lot of bad teacher stories and who knows how many I'll share but this one was from a long time ago back when I was in 5th grade.

So I know this won't be as bad as others but it is entertaining at least I hope it is.

So when I was ten-years-old and in 5th grade, I had two Math teachers who worked together one was named Mrs. J and the other Mrs. B, now Mrs. J was the official teacher of the class while Mrs. B was more of an assistant teacher. Mrs. J wasn't the nicest person in the world but Mrs. B was a total bitch hands down.

It happened when we were doing our daily math assignments which were basically just a group of different math problems on the board that the teacher would sign our names beside. Every student would do this once until everyone had gone which isn't really a problem just kinda stupid in my opinion since no one would do their work they would just wait for the people that were on the board to do it then write it down.

So on this particular day, the teacher had written my name up on the board so I got up to solve it not really thinking about it. I had no clue that had I solved a problem the week earlier and had forgotten about it.

I went to solve the problem and then sat back down in my chair to wait for everyone else to finish their problems. Everyone did and then they went back to their seats because Mrs. B walked up and began to check the answers. Now Mrs. B doesn't usually answer the questions Mrs. J does because she is the one who writes the problems down and writes the students' names down next to them since she was the actual teacher of the class. She's not in the class at the moment because she went to go and copy papers for us to work on.

She stopped at mine and then snapped around to look at me who glaring, me being ten and not having clue what's going on just starred back at her waiting for her to explain how to do the problem and to see if I had gotten it wrong or right. Side note I'm pretty sure I was wrong because I am shit at math.

So as she's looking at me I'm waiting to see what's up with the problem when she suddenly speaks in an angry, sore tone.

""Charlotte, Why did you do this problem!?"" She asks anger in her voice as she points to my name on the board.

""Because, My name was up there, Ma'am,"" I say not being a smart ass but just explain what everyone in the class knows.

""Don't take that tone of voice with me!"" She yelled making us all jump a little.

She then goes on and on about how I'm a bad student and a horrible little girl because I solved this math problem when it wasn't my turn and that I had gone last week. As she yells at me I start to cry a little because being yelled at by a grown woman over something as stupid as solving a math problem will do that to someone. When she sees me crying she starts yelling I have no reason to cry and that I'm being stupid and that I am stupid. This only caused me to cry harder because honestly wtf.

Now at this point, she's tired of me crying so she tells me if I don't shut up I'm going to the principle's office and at this point, Mrs. J walks back into the room from copying worksheets. Instead of being concerned about the crying student in her class she looks directly at Mrs. B.

""What did she do?"" Mrs. J asks in an annoyed tone as she hates her life.

Mrs. B tells her what happens and about how I solved the problem when I wasn't supposed to and that I deserve to be in trouble for it.

Now, this is the part that makes me the angriest. Mrs. J looks at Mrs. B then at me before saying this.

""Oh, I forgot she went,"" Mrs. J says with a shrug of her shoulders.

Mrs, B looks at Mrs. J then at me and for some reason, I'm expecting her to apologize and you probably already know that's not what's happening. She looks at me and then opens her mouth to say this bullshit.

""Well, She should have known that it wasn't her turn,"" Mrs. B says before turning around and marking my answer in-fucking-correct because I solved it.

That has always pissed me off to this day that me a ten-year-old who can't even remember what the homework the night before was about, was supposed to remember such a minor detail. And even if I had remembered it and solved it she had no right to say all that shit to me about being a horrible person.

Look I'm only making this post to vent because I'm tired of being angry about them and I want to let them go. So I hope posting these stories will help me.

I don't care if you think the stories are true I'm doing this for me and please if you're one of those people that support teachers being abusive assholes please just go the fuck away because I'm tired of hearing ""Well you should have done..."" this type of bullshit.

This won't be my last post there will be more to come so just let me vent please."
The Most Meaningless Grade I Ever Received,"A little background; Our secondary school had quite a few teachers that taught multiple subjects, ie, the french teacher also taught music, two of the science teachers also taught maths, etc.

Our CSPE (civic, social and political education) teacher had been with the school for decades, she was hired to teach PE before my Dad attended, and PE and coaching the volleyball teams were her main priority. For the story, let's call her Mrs. D.

Basically, whenever we were meant to have CSPE, she would decide that we would instead have PE. Only volleyball, though. Never anything else. I was (and still am) very not-athletic, and I hated this. I asked her once, about halfway through first year, if we'd ever get around to actually doing the subject we would eventually be tested for. She threatened me with detention, and I'm pretty sure the only reason she didn't follow through was because she couldn't remember my name.

The only times we actually had CSPE was at Christmas, Easter, and the end of the year, for the mandatory end-of-term exams. We'd normally have a list of short, stupidly basic questions and have our textbooks open to get the answers. Very educational.

The crowning moment was Easter of second year, where our exam was, and I'm not joking, to COPY OUT PAGES FROM OUR TEXTBOOKS AND HAND UP THE COPY. I was pissed due to something unrelated that day, and I decided to start on my homework instead. I didn't even hand in the blank sheets with my name on the top, I just threw them out.

Telling my parents was interesting, since Mam was 'so disappointed', until Dad verified that Mrs. D had been pulling this crap for 40 years. He told me they wouldn't care about the grade I received that term.

I got an A. Talking to other people in the class, it seemed like the grades were basically assigned based on the rollbook, the earlier your name was in the alphabet, the higher your grade.

Thanks, Mrs. D. Still don't know how our government works, but at least I have a meaningless A."
My teacher counted extra credit as a quiz grade,No comment
"I Broke Both My Wrists But ""There's No Crying In Dodgeball"""," This happened when I was in 3rd grade, so about 8-9 years old. I went to a very small private school that I had been attending since Kindergarten. This school had one p.e teacher for the entire elementary school. We’ll call her Ms. B. Now, Ms. B had a teaching style that looking back on was akin to a drill sergeant. It seemed like she never stopped yelling at us in class. Outside of class she was nice enough but in class she was the personification of a pissed off megaphone. I know now that this wasn’t an acceptable way to treat elementary school kids but I was little and had never had any other p.e teacher. I thought I was just being too sensitive. The other girls I my class (this was an all girls school) also never raised objections with this. So basically, I don’t think any of the parents knew how bad it was in class for us. Now every day in p.e all of us had one wish for that class. Dodgeball. Dodgeball meant we would only have to run some warm up laps and then play until time was up. That’s exactly what happened on this day. We finished our warm up laps in the gym and were picked for teams. As always I was the last/one of the last kids to be picked but I didn’t care. I was just happy we wouldn’t have to run a bunch. I don’t remember how far into the game we were or what round it was when it happened. I was one of the last kids in on my side when I got hit with a ball. I was disappointed but not hurt; they were rubber balls thrown by 8 year olds. This is where it gets a little fuzzy. I started making my way towards the place where the other “out” people were when I stepped on a ball and began falling backwards. I reflexively put my hands back to break my fall and then my head hit the floor. I opened my eyes to see the artificial gym lights above me. I was somewhat dazed but I could hear my gym teacher yelling. After a few seconds I realized she was screaming at me to get up. Apparently I had been lying on the floor and she wouldn’t let my classmates help me up saying “She can get up by herself!” I didn’t feel hurt or anything so I moved to get up, pushing on my hands to lift my body off the floor. This was a mistake. I started bawling and holding my hands to my chest as I sat on the gym floor. “There’s no crying in dodgeball! Ms. B shouted from the wall of the gym. At this point I remember her and my classmates looking at me and knew I was expected to get up and just suck it up. I managed to get to my feet, without using my hands, and remember Ms. B telling me to walk to the nurse. As I did I was still sniffling but the pain had gone away. When I got to the nurses office my eyes were red and puffy but I wasn’t crying anymore. She gave me a cup of water after I told her what happened and sat me on the couch. I noticed that my hands were trembling as they held the cup, enough to make the water almost spill, but when I asked her about she said I was just in shock. She called my mom to come and pick me up assuring her I was fine and was just a little shaken. I fell asleep and didn’t wake up until my mom arrived. I didn’t pay attention to what she and the nurse were saying (y’know, boring grownup stuff) and my mom took me to her car. She said that she knows the nurse said I was fine but she was going to take me to the ER just in case. Now at this point I just wanted to go home. I felt very tired and just wanted to lie down and watch tv but I didn’t have the energy to argue very much as we drove to the hospital. We checked in and waited a bit before I was seen by a nurse. She did some tests and even an x-ray before coming back to us and informing my mom that both my wrists were broken. I was very surprised. They didn’t hurt but the nurse informed me I was likely in shock. Boy was she right cause they hurt like hell later. My mom was pissed. Not only had the nurse assured her I was fine but the p.e teacher had made me get up after falling down without even checking on me. Apparently this is very dangerous for young children as this can cause brain damage if they are made to move after taking a big fall like that. My mom had a talk with the principle and while she didn’t sue, which I think she should have, she made sure they knew exactly what they had done wrong and to reprimand Ms. B. Ms. B continued to teach until she eventually retired, I got a story to tell, and I still hate p.e."
Not bad but wierd teacher,"Ok so there was this teacher that I had freshmen year of high school. This teacher was the Spanish teacher, very good at teaching always helped and was generally a good teacher but he said stuff out of line a lot. In the first week of school he was talking in his class and the subject got to cross country the sport and he says “I hope I can be a coach this year, but not boys I WANT to coach girls!” We all asked why and his reply was “there much easier to control and fun to look at!”  We all sat in silent as he hummed. Now even worse I was found cc that year and I was a girl soo, but he turned out not be the coach! Ok so one thing right not to bad maybe a slip up! NOPE! We come into class one day and we’re all telling stories and he joins in and says “ last year at this time (in October) I had students from the school vandalize my van.”   I jokingly said “you should have just arrested them” and he looked at me and smiled and said “well that night I slept out in my van and I brought my gun, if they came back I was going to shoot them in the head-“ goes on to explain how we was going to defend himself in court and how we couldn’t wait to shoot them to show these high school kids who was boss thank god those kids didn’t go that night to his van. Not to mention my best friend is a grade above me so when I was an eight grader she was a freshmen and she told me a story about him. So the story is that in her grade they have twins (both girls) so the teacher says in the middle of class “I had a dream about you two ( the twins) last night” they jokingly ask what and he responds “not appropriate for school but let’s just say I had fun in that dream!” And he just laughed leaving the twins disgusted. So ya sorry bout the long post but here is my wierd  Spanish teacher !!"
My daughters teacher hates women,"So I have a problem.
My daughters history teacher is a waste of space piece of shit of a human.

Misogynistic.

Not a word I'd ever EVER THOUGHT I would feel the need to use.

I am not a overly sensitive person. And you can crack rude jokes at me all day. Its cool. Not gonna get upset or offended. 

This guy tells my daughter that women ruined the US when they won the right to vote. 
It all went downhill after that.

He asked her if she can crochet. She said no. He said she should know how because thats something women should be able to do.

He told her that women need to be women. Men should be men.
Men are strong, women are weak. 
Men are leaders. Women are subservient.

I am sincerely pissed. 

He said in class that if anyone feels that he is a misogynistic pig, he is not and they are over reacting.
Even though he keeps telling the girls to mind their places. Be women.

I am furious.

I cannot believe this is real.

Many kids in her class think he's an ass. A few believe he is correct.

I told her i was sorry for his ignorance and proud of her for seeing what is happening and not freaking out over it.

So I said maybe if you record your class room so another adult can see what's happening some one will do something.

MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME that the principal watches the classroom from time to time and has personally witnessed this shit.

Does nothing.

I am livid.

So happy my kid knows that this is wrong. And isn't being lead to believe that this is normal. 

I'm not sure what can be done about this but this is not ok.

He is a history teacher and this is wrong!!!"
world language teacher is crazy,"my world language teacher is super rude to her students. so what happened was she made a mistake on the worksheet and so a student just pointed it out. btw this student is kinda a teachers pet and she said it in a polite way and stuff. so at first the teacher didn’t even understand what she was saying. so the teacher kept asking the student what she meant. when the teacher finally understood what the student was trying to tell her, the teacher actually called her rude in front of the whole class for repeating it so many times. everybody was all shocked and stuff and that poor girl looked like she was about to cry. 
we also got a new student and the kid didn’t know what he was supposed to do. the teacher literally just told him where to sit and left him there. she didn’t even tell him what to do so he pretty much just sat there for the rest of class until he went up to the teacher (she got super annoyed at him) and told him what to do. also we’ve been working on this huge project and she expects him to finish it in so little time. 
she’s also constantly asking what the other teachers are doing and then doing it herself. sometimes she talks in a language we all don’t know and expect us to understand what she is saying. then gets frustrated when we don’t understand."
Geometry teacher doesn’t explain any valuable information to the class and then wonders why most of the class fails her tests. I have had to teach myself Geometry this whole semester and have managed to keep my grade at a solid B.,"So far I’ve been able to keep a solid grade in this class, but I can sense the wheels are starting to fall off, whenever anybody asks the teacher for help, she either refuses to help or doesn’t explain the right information. However, when I go to any other math teacher for help, I can easily understand their explanation and I am able to understand the lesson. Additionally, the teacher speaks to the class in a condescending tone, and acts like our class is the problem and that we’re the worst class she’s ever had, and she is the only thing that can save us from failing geometry."
My accelerated Algebra 2 teacher has no idea what she's doing.,"She gives us note packets, goes through the notes, and gives one example of how to do what we're learning about that day, then has us try on our own with an EXPONENTIALLY more difficult problem.

To make matters worse, during a test today she was walking around to see how we were doing. She leans over my shoulder to see my work, and I damn near have an asthma attack. Why? Because of the TOBACCO on her breath. The whole situation just sets me on edge."
My AP Physics 1 Teacher doesn’t teach,"Idk what to do because my AP Physics 1 teacher doesn’t know how to teach. It really sucks because I’m normally a straight A student, but her class sucks. She’s repeatedly had to make announcements to our class about how shitty our test averages are. If this was an academic class, I wouldn’t care, but it’s an AP class; we have the national test at the end of the year. No one in the class knows what we’re doing; any advice?"
It is time to address the accountability in Oklahoma Public Schools!,
"Norman Oklahoma Public School - Teacher Arrested With Heroin and Syringes October30, 2019",
this teacher knows this and still has the nerve,"I live in a small town in Australia and attend the local high school, the teachers are good for the most part but there is one teacher that is just so shit and here’s why. I have ADHD and Dyslexia and cause of this I am not able do some of the work that the other kids do and not as quick and the teacher is fully aware of this but she still has the audacity to publicly shame me for not finishing certain bits of work that the other kids have finished. And on top of that she is always yelling at us for no reasons like the iPads didn’t charge properly"
Teacher didn't teach and I got in trouble,"So I had this supply teacher for all of last week to monday that week and she would tell us every morning to get our math, out witch we did, but when she came we were starting a new unit in math so she had to tell how to do or Teach it to us but she didn't think that we needed to be taught how to do this so we kinda just sat there not doing anything because we didn't know what to do. ( we as in the whole class) Eventually I had enough (I had anger issues) and I flipped out and told her that I didn't understand and that if she wasn't going to teach me the stuff I didn't understand I was not going to do anything and I used some cuss words but she didn't care, so later on like 15 minutes later the principal (let's call me Mr.D) came in and saw me talking to my friend let's call her S, so he came in and took us to different rooms and made us sit there for an hour in silence then took us into a new room where S and I got to sit together, he told us that since we were talking and giggling with each other that's why we were there not because I screamed at the teacher, and well S and I told him that she wasn't teaching us or explaining and when we asked for help she would just walk away and this happend 

Mr.D 
So do you to know why your here 

S
Nope

Me 
You never told us soo no 

Mr.D
Well you two when I walked into the class were sitting and talking to each other and disturbing the whole class (everyone was talking)

Me 
Everyone was talking because she cant teach so nobody was doing anything 

Mr.D
That doesn't matter, you weren't doing anything but talking (like everyone in that room)

S
So was everyone else tho 

Me 
The teacher has been choosing not to teach for all of last week and all of this week and that doesn't matter to you?

Mr.D
It matters but do you think talking to each other was fair to Mrs. Bitch titty 

Me 
Yes she wasn't doing her job, why dont you care about that?

Mr.D
So you think that was fair

S
Yes

Me
Yes

Mr.D
Well it wasn't and if you two cant learn then come down her I'll give you two a nice empty room to work in

Me
But that's not what we need we need someone to teach us 

Mr.D
Then I'll get someone to tell you what your doing 

S
Hes not going to work with us 

Me
I know, he doesn't care 

Mr.D 
I do care but what you did was disrespectful and unfair 

Me
(Shouting) What ever your not going to f*cking do anything so why the f*ck bring us here knowing that we just want to learn but we cant learn because this dumb f*cking lady wont teach us 

Mr.D
Watch your language, and if you want help come here, and now next time your with her be nice and dont disturb the class 

Me
Your stupid, we aren't the only ones so you better that the whole f*cking class come down 

Mr.D
No, they weren't doing anything but talking 

S
Just like us

Me
(Shouting) What the h*ll you stupid f*cking man Nobody was learning not just us so do your job and make sure shes doing hers so we dont fail our tests because this sh*t is dumb

Mr.D 
It's time for your next class, now go before your late 

Then we left and went to our class. Do you think it was right for us to get in that much trouble (our parents were called aswell) 

P.S Mr.D knows that I have anger issues.
  This was written on a phone so sorry if there are any mistakes.
  This happend today so I'm kinda just blowing off steam.
  Also S and I are grade 8.
    If you have any questions just ask I'll answer them in the comments"

teacher sends me to the dean for not leting me talk to my frend who got raped,"this is a shortie but really makes my blood boil 

me: me  

friend :  (fake name) cassie

teacher: \[redacted\]

my friend cassie posted on snap that she was not good and I replied asking if everything was okay he had been raped and she was not doing to well so I wanted to help her after just that and I felt horrible and started talking to her the bell rang and it was my next class and after that I went to Mr.\[DATA-EXPUNGED\]s class and he was angry from his last class and made a permanent no phones rule she was still messaging me by the time he finished his speel so asked I could use my phone he said sternly no unless its an emergency and this isn't one. I explained to him what happened when he got angry for saying what happened and promptly sent me to the dean

on mobile rn so sorry for bad formatting"
"Not a teacher, but my schools attendance officer","Ok this takes place in the uk in 2012, and is about my attendance officer at the time, I was in year 10 and my asthma had been very bad that year, and I kept of having time off to see the doctor and depending on the doctor would tell me to take a few days of with antibiotics and steroids and other would just give me antibiotics and steroids and let me go to school, but because I had time off because of my asthma my attendance officer actually called my mum to say if I had any more time off I will get a behaviour point because of my attendance, I had to travel with other students on a taxi for over an hour, and was always waiting and never nicked of school (played hookie) I always went to school no matter what, but on the 24th November 2012 (I remember the day, because I actually thought I was going to die.) I had a severe Asthma attack that hospitalised me for three days, (it was a monday I was admitted and it was teacher training day) but my mum rang the school stating I wouldn't be in for the week because I was in hospital and I was having nebulisers and I had to have strong IV antibiotics and X-rays that showed a bad chest infection that was due to stress, the cold spray deodorants and other things, triggered this asthma attack, but whilst my mum was on the phone he was shouting saying I should be in, that my attendance was low and that I would get a behaviour mark (for bad behaviour) and the doctor who was treating me asked for the phone and said to him how ill I was and that i couldn't help it, that I was actually in hospital (he didn't believe my mum), the doctor also told me off because I had a mock History exam and that is all i could think of and that I had to go to school because if this Mock Exam.

when I finished year 10 I got my review and saw a behaviour point, I was actually crying because I never had a behaviour point, only reward points, and my Form Tutor said it was because of my attendance (it was about 79.9%) and i never had under 97%, I was told their was nothing that can be done, that it would me on my permanent record, but a different teacher who was apart of the support assistant, and he got that behaviour point removed, and I had no trouble from then on."
"History repeats itself, Again.","Cast (even though there are only like 3 lines of dialogue.)

* Me: Microscopic Egg
* Student: my Friend from history class
* Teacher/Mr. \[redacted\]

The student and I talked after class, and it turns out that he has stuff happening at home and that it doesn't help that Mr. \[redacted\] yells at him every class. It is obvious that Student is suffering from severe ADHD and depression because I've known him for the past 5 years and he did his work well up until his parents got divorced in the 6th grade.

So today in class we sat next to each other so I can hear what the teacher has to say, Student and I do our assignment for the day and I help Student make up some missing work.

Then Mr. \[redacted hands out a project that is basically to make a poster, Do a 3-page essay, and then do the same thing, next class. Student is feeling kind of stressed; so he takes a break from doing missing work and Watches an Emkay video.(love you [r/EmKay](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmKay) )

Mr. \[redacted\] almost immediately comes over and says that he has to ""Get the milk, get the eggs, and make an omelet."" Student says ""What? That makes no sense."" Mr \[redacted\] scolded him about how you make an omelet when we were supposed to be going over the English Reformation and the Grand Revolution (Sorry I'm a history nerd)

Well, that's all for now, remember kids, don't be mean and don't let history repeat itself."
Bad Day Care Teacher,"Not sure if this fits here but if you find a place to post it where it is better suited, do let me know.

So this happened all the way back when I was in Grade 1. Both of my parents worked so I was put in the care of my mom's friend who ran a day care out of her house.

It was me, one of my friends, his younger sister and the day care teachers 2 boys.

I have two stories from this day care so sit down and get comfy.

Cast
Me: Me
DT: Day Care Teacher
F: Friend

Story #1: It was a warm day outside. So DT decided that we were going to paint outside. She set up one of those plastic easels for us to use gave us paper and paint and let us paint.

I started painting happily. I wasn't really painting anything particular. Just so far putting red and orange on a piece of paper. 

But then the orange and red mixed together and it made me think of fall leaves. So I abandoned the paintbrush and started mixing and swirling the paint on my paper until I thought it looked good. To me it was like if you stood in a woods in the middle of fall and the wind blows the leaves causing them to swirl around you in a ocean of color.

DT however, did not like my art. She told me that I should have painted a house like everyone else did. She was angry at me for ""making a mess of my paper""

I didn't get paint everywhere. None of the paints Everyone used were mixed together. Just my picture was a ""mess"" She actually told my mom and showed her my picture telling her to teach me to ""paint normally""

I was in tears the whole way home.

Story #2: All of us kids were playing inside. We were all in the basement. I was kinda in the corner reading. F came up to me asking if I wanted to play. I nicely said ""Thank you. But I would like to read by myself. Maybe later.""

F understood and ran off to play with his sister. But DT heard what I said and thundered down the stairs.

She started scolding me for saying I wanted to be by myself. She said that I was with other kids so I can't be by myself so I had to play with the other kids.

I told her I just wanted to read for the moment. None of the other kids playing around me were bothersome to me. But DT didn't care. She kept scolding me in front of all the kids saying that people who wanted to be alone were crazy who heard voices in their heads and threatened to tell my mom. I started to cry.

DT said ""Fine! You want to be by yourself then I'll give you that"" she took me upstairs to a small room and shut me in there. I was still crying but decided to just read my book. I read my book and calmed myself down.

 I decided since I was done reading I wanted to go play but when I tried to leave the small room DT was there and yelled at me. Saying how ""I wanted to be alone so I was now alone."" 

I started to cry again thinking I was being punished. She continues to say that if I wanted to be alone she was going to get me used to being alone. She made me stay in that room until my mom came.

I truely believe that the second story is why I'm so scared of being alone or asking to be left alone.

So those are my stories of my bad Day Care Teacher."
Teacher got entire lesson wrong,"I usually try to correct teachers politely if they get an important thing wrong to try not be a smart ass but i just stayed quite the entire lesson because they knew basically nothing. we where learning about Hiroshima for philosophy & Ethics. kind of excited as i love WW2 history but my expectation for this lesson was destroyed. Things they got wrong (The most extreme ones): Hiroshima bomb at point 0 was 10 million degrees Celsius, Enola gay was the name of the pilot,plane, and the bomb, everyone in a 32 mile radius where killed, and lastly you either where killed instantly or died from radiation sickness... the teacher also would've told us about the real horrific things that happened as she didn't shy away from stuff ISIS have done. really annoyed me as it wasn't one or two but the entire lesson which was false the only thing right was the date and the bomb hit Hiroshima. I feel like more people should know about Hiroshima properly. It was kinda just a lesson of suffering in silence and felt bad for the people around me. kind of made me think about other lessons where i  have been taught fake facts without knowing. :P"
Teacher can't accept her own font that she herself types in,"So my Spanish teacher  is this really bad teacher. I mean REALLY BAD. To explain, the Spanish textbooks are published by Vista Higher Learning (VHL for short).
VHL has this ""Supersite"" where they have all these activities and things like that. Most importantly, they publish about a full course, so the teacher has no job, to be honest. It's just printed out worksheets and relax. Really when you do that it just makes you extra garbage at making your own things to hand out. So one day she assigns this really long sheet that she actually made herself (a first), which has 15 questions written in font 10 or so on Microsoft word.  The answer to these questions are all very long as well. So she gives us like 10 minutes to finish it and assigns the rest for weekend homework. So if she typed so small, I wrote even smaller, just to get all of it on the page. Of course she gives it back saying that ""she couldn't read it."" and some other garbage excuse. If you type so small, don't expect huge writing. So I decide to to type it just like she did. She then tells me that I can't type it either, and I have to handwrite it. Not even a reason why. So I suffer and handwrite the assignment for the THIRD time, just because she has a massive amount of excuses to throw up. I'll probably fail anyways. And the kid next to me writes this unreadable cursive and she really doesn't care."
My teacher broke my foot,"For backstory: I play rugby for my towns club and school team in the UK. I play in the position of hooker(the main man in the Scrum),and muit is dangerous if done wrong. Ive broken my hand before this injury due to rugby. My team many more

Me: me
Teacher: Coach 
Team(1,2,3etc): my team mates 

My team had an all day tournament at a private school(im in public). We team only had me as there hooker, no one else was changed,school after our first period lesson. Once we arrived my year groups team(year 8 or grade 7) we had to wait to sign in our year Below's team and then we went to sign our team in, once we were we had 5 minutes to do a warm up. Coach made us do a tackling drill, were you were in partners and you had to be on one knee with your partner tackling from straight on. If your a rugby player you will know thats the wrong way of tackling. 

If you go straight in at a player when there on one knee you can push back the person and keep there foot or leg in the same position, makinp them break

That's what happened to me on the second time we did the drill.i got tackled my my teammate and my foot was put in the wrong position and broke.Coach always acted as if an injury was fake. I put my self as sub that first game, i took my shoe off and the bone was popping out the foot, luckily not pierced the skin. My coach saw and knew it was Bad, he called my mum for my dad to pick me up, which he did 3 hours after i had the injury.

After story: We went to the local minor injuries unit, where they did an X-ray and it showed a break. I was in a cast and crutches for a week until i got a Boot put on which im in for 6 weeks

If you want more stories of this teach just ask
We also won the tournament"
My 1st grader is having issues in school.,"So, a little backstory. I have a 7 year old little girl. Her, her mother and sister are the love of my life so it irritates me that I have to constantly here from my 7 year old that when she is in school, she is bullied, made fun of, left out and just completely disrespected by teachers and students alike. It's been so bad a couple times that when I pick her up from the bus, she is in tears from the emotional struggling she has to go thru just to get an education in this S*** hole school. So a couple days ago she came home and told her mom that when she is in music class, if she has to go to the bathroom, they will let you but when you come back, you have to sit outside the door and not participate for the whole class. How is that ok? I can't believe the kind of struggles my daughter has to go through at such a young age. This is just one incident. she has told me that when kids pick on her and make fun of her that she tells the teacher and the teacher tells her that they need to work it out amongst themselves. My wife has also been told by HER teacher that she can't even use the word ""bully"" until there is a ""three time"" occurrence with the bully in question. Only then can they do anything about it. I'm about to go raise he// at this school and I'm just wanting some assurance that I'm not wrong here. My daughter deserves better classmates and teachers. She is so sweet and nice and she is very quiet and has trouble making friends but at the same time she is so desperate for friendship and to be accepted (like most kids). Has anybody dealt with things in this nature that might have some advice on how i should handle this? Much appreciated to any who took the time to read this.

UPDATE: we have had some conversations with my daughters teachers and my kid is reporting now that she has made some friends and teachers have been much more attentive to the problems between kids in the class. thx to everyone for their advice. I'm just glad my daughter is having an easier time and things are back on track. THANK YOU ALL!"
Teacher yells at students for remembering victims of the holocaust,"**This was a text from my friend, this didn’t happen to me. I changed the names. Also, we were at the holocaust museum. There were candles there. Also, we have a terrible teacher we’ll call Mrs. Karen in this story.


So me and my friend wanted to light a candle in memory the people who died in the Holocaust because we are both Jewish. We went into the the hall of remembrance so we could light candles and we circled the place looking for a match or a stick we could use to light a candle. We saw that there were none left and we saw people using scraps of paper and light them using another candle and lighting there own candle. Me and my friend asked a girl for some and she gave us some small scraps. We realized that we would burn ourselves if we used them because of how small they were. Then we kept looking around for bigger pieces of paper. We saw a match box and I had the idea of lighting that to light our own candle. So we ripped the box and then lit it using another candle. As my friend was doing this a cop came up to us with Mrs Karen right behind him and said “you need to come with me.” (My theory is that mrs obrian pointed us out to the cop) So we went with this cop and Mrs Karen to talk in the hallway. A second cop came with a admin of the museum. Mrs Karen wasn’t interested in the truth at all and said “do we need to call their parents.” The cop was like “that’s your decision we are not involved in that part.” Then we pointed out that we were Jewish and the admin said that we could light a candle with him. We went back in and right before we were gonna light it, Mrs Karen started lecturing us. She said “in Nazi Germany people blindly followed hitler and the nazi’s like sheep. That’s a lot like what you were doing today, following what everyone else was doing by lighting paper on fire instead of using a match.” (She has been calling people sheep all trip) Then she said “I’m not trying to compare you to nazi’s.” We have yet to receive a apology from her. She just tried to justify what she had said. At this point me and my friend were in shock and didn’t know how to react because a teacher just said that to us. After that we just walked to the bus. **The reason I was upset was because of something different combined with this which just set me over the edge.**"
High substitute,"Mobile user yak yak you know the deal.

About a year ago our piece of crap for a teacher was somewhere (he wouldn’t tell us where he went) and we had a sub and everyone was happy that our teacher was gone and it was no problem.

That changed when we all first stepped inside the classroom. The dude looked high as a kite. We’re talkin the dude had the eyes of Sauron, red as hell. 

Now some kids didn‘t know what a high dude looked like so some people thought he was tired but the rest of us knew that this guy was on cloud nine.

He had all the rest of the features of a super high guy like intense muscle sagging, slurred speech, and he kept a bag of Cheetos under his desk that he thought no one saw him eating but we did. Anyway he was the whole ordeal of a high person.

Later in class people started to get suspicious of him and we began asking him questions about what he did on a daily basis because we “wanted to know what his life was like“. The period ended and we all went home wondering what he was on.

It was later found out that about 5 years before this he hid marijuana in a pencil sharpener and the school brought him back thinking that he would be fine after 5 years.

BTW the guy still subbed for the school for the next 2 years and nobody did anything about it."
A really bad teacher,"This story is about my 5th grade teacher, Ms.Butthole. She was the one that everyone dispised and didn't want to have as a teacher.

 As you can guess, she was my teacher. She was nice for the first month. Red flags started apearing. One day, i turned in my science project that i worked on for weeks. It was a little demostration of the planets. 

When I turned it in, she said, ""Thanks! See you tomorrow"". So i left. The next day, I saw MY project in the trash.

At first, i thought, ""hmm she must have trown it since she didnt have any room and must have graded it already""

I was wrong

She then posted our grades on a website so we can check them (the grades are only seen by the repective students). I checked mine and it said ""Planetery Project, MISSING""

I was confused. (To keep it under 1000 words, ill tell what happens in comments)

Next story

At fall, my parents were fighting really badly, and I was a sensitive kid. I fell into a depression. Not as bad as others but enough to show something was wrong. After a while, I started to see a school counselor. He was the nicest person I've ever met. I'll call him Mr.NiceGuy. (or NG for short).

He helped me get out of depression. After a while i was happy. We kept on seeing each other. But Valentine's day was the day that I dreaded (and still do) because my parents have a fight all the time (6 years straight). I was really sad again because my parents split up for a week. After seeing him. Ms.Butthole thought it would be a good idea to take me out of counseling.

Her excuse? ""Its taking up MY precious teaching time and i dont want to waste my time on some nobody kid who wont get anywhere revewing what we were talking about.""

I was really sad again because of that. We started seeing each other in secret during lunch and I explaned everyrhing while bawling my eyes out. She later on adter the year ended got fired from that school and needed to move to another DISTRICT. That's not all but I'll post it if you guys want me to."
teacher yells at students for putting laptops away,"As of writing this it has been at least three days this teacher has been in my school and mainly everyone hates her. Every time i ask about her to someone they dislike her and here is what i have observed and the first day of meeting her made feel like this woman was unstable.

For a little backstory other pass incidents she is new and being in high school these days no one gave her respect i would get she would get a little ticked off but not to a extreme degree where she would yell at students, even when she inst yelling she is so close minded and gullible. One day while she made us look up politicians and even talked about her political party keep in mind the class she teaches is online and marketing not the world of politicians and even so i don't think its good to talk about your political party.

&#x200B;

anyways this happened today class was beginning to end and the class full of sophomores none of them put their computers away properly and everyone already left no problem. but its a problem for the teacher where she yells at us to get out of her classroom while were fixing the laptops. my friend goes its not our fault that students don't know how to put computers away. This woman had the audacity to say it WAS OUR FAULT. she then goes to another one of my friends and says ""You are so smart about a lot of things you should be smart with time get to your next class.""

even though we had enough time to get to our next class and fix the laptops because everyone left early. I mean we are teens but yelling and saying things like that isn't going to give you respect. i honestly already want her gone she is to unstable and i fear for more days with her"
Abusive Teacher Throughout 3rd To 5th Grade,"This is gonna be a long one so buckle up and get ready to be triggered!

When I was in 3rd grade I had very extensive anger issues that stemmed from my bad home life and bad teachers, my 1st elementary school wanted to send me to a mental institution (a very big overreaction mind you because I did have anger issues and had (still do) severe ODD.They settled on transferring me to a new school.

and I am not afraid to mention the name of it because that school single handedly caused me many issues and mental problems that continue to torment me even to this day.
At Pleasant Hill Elementary (How ironic of a name) the teachers were,how should I say this,below par and very bad.Many of them were downright abusive towards me in particular.My math teacher would ridicule me for making mistakes and would even threaten telling Ms Lee (remember that name it'll be important later) about me just going to the bathroom everyday in her class, but the thing was,I didn't go everyday at the same time so she was just doing this to torment me.She also had no care for me when I was being bullied or if I got depressed or mad which I did a lot of the time (still in 3rd grade here folks)
If I was being bullied the solution was to send me to my Sped class so I could be abused by the teachers in that class,Ms Lee and Ms Soto were the definition of abusive, their punishments for simple acts such as crying,talking too loud,or even just looking angry or sad included:Walking or running in place for nearly over an hour,filling out stacks of math pages some of the stacks even reaching a foot tall and you got more added to the stack if you cried,got angry,or moved your legs,this was supposed to be a safe place for disabled or troubled kids but it wasn't a safe space it was a nightmare having to go there and I had anxiety attacks when I thought about going to that class,at 3rd fucking grade.The part about it I remember the most vividly and what horrified me then and horrifies me now is when I said I was going to tell my mom about the abuse she said (angrily whispered) to me ""What happens in this room,stays in this room""....

But that's not all,if you tried to run away from her classroom or if you were crying or (remember,still 3-4th graders here) self harmed they would push you to the ground and hold your arms behind your back,and these are grown adults doing this to as young as 7 year olds.Kids would self harm regularly and the teachers did nothing.One of my teachers found my sketchbook and noticed my suicidal hinting art and sent me to the counselor but they only made it worse,they said when I walked in word for word ""Do you want to die,*name*?"" And remembering what Ms Lee had said earlier that month ""what happens in this room,stays in this room"" I didn't tell the truth,I said ""no"" and she let me leave,I was now 9 at this point and my self harming at become a real problem,no one knew and I tried to kill myself twice.I can't trust people like I used to because I'm terrified they'll be like Ms Lee or that they'll hurt me,I get panic and anxiety attacks when I get reminded of her,her classes caused me to develop an anxiety disorder and mild to severe depression as well as a collection of other problems,I was finally freed from her in 5th grade when I moved to my new current school (middle school) her abuse still haunts me and I still self harm and have suicidal thoughts and anxiety attacks because of her.

Ms Lee,if you ever read this story,I'm not joking when I say I hope you fucking die or at the least suffer like you made me suffer for two agonizing And tortures years.

Thank you for reading if you have made it this far!"
Teacher makes kid cry over his drawing,"I'm am on mobile so sorry for spelling mistakes and this story is about my friend 

So in 7th grade we had a science activity  (that's what they called in South Africa) we had to draw plants and flowers simple right but my friend is not good at drawing so he tries to draw these flowers (which are ugly as fuck) my teacher comes over and says ""no that rubbish you slacking and need try harder and he needed to rip the page out"" so my friend is very up set and kinda starts crying a bit but no that much

This isn't the first of this bullshit and sfter this he hates this bitch even more

Dear teacher please step on a landmine

So we can laugh at your grave."
Teachers that forever haunt me,"Sorry this is a super long post but is a rant I have held for awhile and just want to write it out.

&#x200B;

I have had several down right terrible teachers in my life that have either left a bad taste in my mouth or have forever ruined an entire subject from the interactions they left. As a person who has had several laerning or mental disabilities this will always bring out the best or worst in teachers and always has had me hold my breath with every new teacher or professor I ever encounter.

&#x200B;

Had one elementary school teacher believe that all my conditions were made up just so I could get special treatment and that my parents must be hippies to not try to restrain me to focus or use pills to calm me down. Thankfully the science teacher who has been friends with my family for years have my back and defend my parents on what was best for me. (science teachers wife was my sister NCIU nurse and had their first son at the same time in the same ward together, so our families easy to say got close from that experience together). When this failed they tried to get me diagnosed with ODD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and that set my parents into full protection mode of me. That is not something you just throw around and ended up with me taking a bunch of psychological exams to prove that I did not have ODD but moderate to severe ADHD. After all of this it made most of the teachers afraid to have me in their classes, until they would meet me and my parents and know the truth. But this left me and my parents a very long road every year with the same kind of fight to prove everything over and over again.

&#x200B;

 I used to be an A student and math and loved being a nerd until high school were I met such a miserable teacher he has forever scared math for me and even get physically upset or even vomit when I need to take a course, and tests are worse. He did pretty nothing most of the time and just literally did online shopping during class. This man loved to belittle students who did not meet his standards and would get down right cruel. His favorite was a girl I knew who sadly would miss 1 to 2 days a week of school and he finally said ""Well look who has decided to grace us with their presence today! What an honor"" in the most derogatory tone I have ever heard. She left the room and tears and everyone was silent but was a final straw for me. I stood up and said ""If you only knew why she missed class and even tried to be a good teacher you would know why that was terrible to say."" He looked at me with daggers and I said with a raised voice ""She takes care of her disabled terminally ill grandmother and have to raise her twin siblings and has no choice but to get a job to help out, but of course you would never know for you don't care."" After that he took a second and said in a calm cold tone ""You know you will never amount to anything in life, no one will care or even remember you. It is a same to have such a disappointing student in my class."" Everyone just sat in silence because of this man. When class was over I calmly left, went to my homeroom teacher and cried in silence before calling my mother and tell her what he just said. After this and a few other things happened, he had a permanent aid in every class he had, and half the class was emergency moved to another teacher and course. I don't think he ever taught a class after that year and only had study periods. 

&#x200B;

This was my first experience with college and it went down very quickly. I had to take a summer intermediate English course to help me all classes to college level and of course was not my strong suit. The professor was not amused they got stuck pretty much watching in her mind 20 dumb people for 3 hours a day. This professor ask me bluntly in front of the entire course if I have a mental problem, which is very much illegal and left me mortified. After she learned I did she actually forced me to go to the student center of the college that was not even open yet to get EVERYTHING I wrote doubled checked. I went and say they were not even open for another 4 weeks, so I went back and told them this and the reply""Well I saw a car parked over their so someone is in their! This need a signature on it by 5 or you fail this work."" So I went back and sat on a porch of this place for 30 minutes until the person who is setting up the place stumbles upon me. Of course the who ran the center was more then mad that a student just randomly shows up and says I need this verified by 5 today so professor wont fail me. Once she heard the professors name I could feel the eyes rolling so had to pretty much hold this poor lady hostage every time I had work, everyday. Of course I told my mother about her and she went nuts as its illegal where we lived to ask a student private questions, let alone in front of other. I ended up taking a test and passing with a low B that the dean of the college proctored that lead the professor to hold a grudge on me, and having her friends what were other professors make my first semester a living nightmare."
History Repeats itself.,"In my middle school, there are multiple teachers that everyone hates. My history teacher is one of those teachers.

Two days ago I'm in his class doing history homework when he starts telling a kid about how he is not gonna be good in a job environment because he wasn't doing a 5-page assignment. And the questions, you know those written answer questions that are really annoying? Well, those are all of those questions combined with the math problems that have multiple parts. 

He has done this for the past 5 years according to my older sister who is now in nursing school, and that he was pulling the same stuff back then. He gives out the same assignment with different questions and images every class, then the next class TWO DAYS LATER; he expects us to be done with the essay sized paper each class, which includes putting in an image for every person's name we include and he wakes up sleeping kids by saying ""if you have a full-time job, take care of kids, and has homework, then you will be fired in your jobs."" 

I have more horrible teacher stories if you would like to hear more but until next time. -*Geeked*"
Seventh grade ELA teacher,"   My seventh grade ELA teacher who despite it being the beginning of the school year abuses the discipline system by threatening us with detention without any verbal warnings. In addition to this, after the first test despite the highest grade in an all accelerated class being an 80 she refused to drop the test or modify it in anyway because she claims we weren’t  “paying attention” in class. She also has grudges against us due to her not believing in things like global warming when we happened to be doing an assignment related to it."
This man in my fifth hour fell asleep,
Very conservative teacher. . .,"When I was in 9th grade Government we were doing the lesson of the political spectrum and my teacher had our class take a test to see where we stood. I, at the time, was placed as a radical or strong liberal. I'm still liberal now but not a radical.
After everyone was finished with their test she had us line up to the percentage we got. I, of course, was at the left end of the line and she asked what percentage mine was after asking the kid on the right. His was 70 something mine was 94, she looked at me is disbelief and told me(in front of the whole class mind you) that there's no way a student could have that strong of an opinion on politics and had me retake the test. The whole class was watching me take the test again and low and behold 94, she then glared at me and told me I was faking questions to get my precent. I tried to defend myself by saying I do research and watch the news on current events. 
She then told me to wait in the hall and she'll have a chat with me later. I did what I was told and she came in the hall after telling students to read whatever chapter in the book. She then started spewing her political standpoint on me(immigrants stealing our jobs, disabled people stealing government money, that kind of stuff) and that I, a student, will never understand those kind of things. I nodded my head, I knew if I said anything I'll be going to the dean's office(not a good place to be sent). The bell rang in the middle of her rant and I walked away from her, done with her shenanigans.
I first went to my counselor to switch my class, luckily I was able to. Then I went to the principal to report her for shoving her political opinion on me, I found out later that she never got fired and not even a warning. That's when I hated my principal and my school.
(I have had many run-ins with my principal in my highschool career, she hated me for the time I was there. I disagreed with the system and pushed for some changes, that's where she began to hate me.) Now I'm free with my highschool degree."
"My bad ""Retail"" teacher","I had completely forgotten about this teacher until today when I glanced down at my bookshelf and spotted my high school year books. So I'm posting about him because it was a pain in the butt dealing with this guy.

I'm calling him ""Mr. Chill"" because even though he was a chill guy, he was maybe too chill.

The first problem with ""Mr. Chill"" was the fact he came 15-20 minutes late to the first period class EVERYDAY!!

Our Class started at 9:30. His reason for always being late was that his house was beside 2 sets of train tracks. He was claim he would leave his house at 6:00am and get ""stuck"" at the train tracks by a train.

He was stuck waiting for train to go by...for 3 and a half hours EVERYDAY?! There were students who lived OUTSIDE OF THE CITY and still managed to bus to school on time.

The second problem was the class itself. It was in the class listings as a ""Retail Class"" so I signed up figuring I would be learning some retail skills for getting a retail job!

No..no..not at all. We did a bunch of Photoshop projects then he stuck the whole class on helping him with doing the yearbook even though he had a whole ""YEARBOOK CLUB"" that was doing yearbook projects.

Needless to say that turned into a HUGE mess with the Yearbook Club. The two leaders of the Yearbook Club I was close friends with and ""Mr. Chill"" knew about that. So he would constantly ask me to ask my friends why the yearbook wasn't getting done fast enough and why he had to be ""forced"" to get his ""Retail"" class to pitch in.

The reason the yearbook wasn't getting done fast enough was because he would let our class mess with things that were already done!! Then the Yearbook Club would have to go back and fix it.

Then we come to the final and third problem.

I was instructed by ""Mr. Chill"" to make up yearbook quotes for those people who either didn't want nor hand in a quote for the graduation pictures pages.

So I made up a couple generic ones and decided to run them past my friends so to not make more work just in case it was done already. They said that it was fine. Good. I input the quotes where needed then log out. My account on the website we were using besides the yearbook club leaders was the only account that could change the quotes.

The following day I was home sick when I get a message from one of my Yearbook Club leader friends asking me why I changed a bunch of quotes that hadn't needed to be changed. I responded that I hadn't because I was at home sick.

They told me that the website showed that I made the changes. So I messaged one of my other friends in my ""Retail"" class and was shocked by what I was told.

She told me that one of the boys in the class suddenly decided he wanted a different graduation quote but because I wasn't there instead of telling the boy to run it past actual Yearbook Club to get it changed, ""Mr. Chill"" GAVE THE BOY MY ACCOUNT USERNAME AND PASSWORD TO GO IN AND CHANGE HIS QUOTE. 

This boy then proceeded to change a bunch of quotes to stupid things knowing I would get blamed for it because it was my account. I was pretty pissed because each of our accounts on that website used our personal emails because ""Mr. Chill"" said that it was easier then using our school emails.

I felt so......mad that he just gave that to a random boy in my class like that. He still proceeded to put the classes picture in the yearbook with the caption that we ""put together the yearbook."" We didn't put it together! We made everything worse!! The Yearbook Club picture had the caption of ""helped with yearbook""

Yearbook Club had to go in and fix EVERYTHING my class did. Our pictures didn't deserve to be in the yearbook at all. Yearbook Club was the ones who had to suffer and struggle with ""Mr. Chill"". He even told one of my leader friends when she went and told him she was going to miss one Yearbook Club meeting due to a family emergency that she ""wasn't committed"" to Yearbook Club and should probably ""quit if you aren't going to put in your all""

Two weeks later he asked her in the hall about if the Yearbook was almost done.

So that was ""Mr. Chill"" the not Retail teacher."
I can’t tell if one of my teachers can’t teach or if I am not able to adjust to his teaching style.,"Since the beginning of the school year in August, I have had this one teacher for 2 classes, Physics and Computer Science. I am a senior in high school. He is a graduate from Auburn who played football for them. There is a problem I am noticing in his classes though. I don’t seem to be learning anything. I also notice his teaching style is dramatically different than all the other teachers at my school. For example, he will use basically an Elmo(a camera that you use to put work on a projector screen) instead of the chalkboard most of the time for physics and I can’t read half of what he is writing. I also cannot keep up with his very fast pace. He also will rely on Khan Academy as one of the primary teaching tools which I cannot really learn effectively from. That and a combination of other things have seemed to have hindered my ability to learn in his classes. I don’t know if he can’t teach, or if I am just not able to adapt to his style. I am trying to keep an open mind since I think he's a nice guy but I do question him a bit. I thought he studied engineering in college but he has had me help him with things a couple times. He had me change the light bulb in his projector. I am just confused and don’t feel like I’m learning. Keep in mind though that I haven’t asked for much help. I haven’t gotten comfortable with him enough yet to easily ask questions since I don't have the best social skills. I just kinda don’t like the whole teaching style either though and I feel that I would need a ton of help to really learn anything."
"Has anyone had a college American Literature teacher make you do something like this? I have to do this after writing an essay. I feel like this is a stupid, huge waste of time.",
I exploited my bad handwriting because i was lazy,When i was in fourth grade my teacher made everyone do a report on a part book every day. But i was lazy so i wrote worse then just put the same book report everyday and never got caught because my teacher was too lazy to take the time to try to read it.
"College Officials Agreed to Keep Quiet About Professor Who Had Trove of Nude Student Photos, Sex Videos",
The Home Economic teacher from hell,"So in 8th grade I had a home ec teacher that would tell us to go somewhere and then yell at us for going there. One day just before the term break she lost the tub of fabric. Instead of providing replacement fabrics she just yelled at the kids who now had no fabric. She then told them that the must go out and buy new fabrics. However she did not tell us the size, shape, type of material and colours that we could choose. When we came back. Surprise surprise no one had fabric. One poor kid who had not lost his fabric asked for help with ironing and sewing. She helped. Only for her ironing to be below her standard. She then redid it and blamed it on the kid for her bad ironing. Later that class she took that same kids work and started to sew it. She ripped it and then asked who ripped it. The kid said that she did it. She said i don’t care get my class and come back when you can see properly. She then complained to him about how bad his skills were. This kid’s skills were top of the class which matched the teachers skill. That teacher was an absolute nightmare and to top it off I had here for geography and homegroup everyday."
My stupid Teacher,
The Nun and the Ruler,"This happened when I was in preschool. As my mother was still a part of the Navy, my parents decided to send me to a Navy affiliated preschool. The school they initially chose was connected to the Catholic Church--which immediately set off my Dad into an ""I don't think this will work mode"" as he didn't have great relationship with the church as he had grown up and left it, but my Mom loved the class size and that it was local to us. 

This school was a nightmare. On my first and only day, I met my teacher, a nun who I will forever hate. The horrid woman was all smiles and kindness to my parents and adults but as soon as they left and she knew they were gone (about 1/2 hour later) she began  singling me out for wearing a skort (shorts built in under a skirt) and she pulled out a ruler and put it up to my leg, showing me how long my skirt had to be at their school. Then she smacked my bottom with the ruler. I screamed and she grabbed my hand and slapped the back of it two more times with the ruler for being loud and disrespectful. I quieted down and hid from her until recess. During recess, I found the the kids' jungle gym had this area under the slide that I could fit into. I don't remember the decision process to hide, but I do remember crawling in the sand and getting myself really wedged in tight in there. 

When the class was called to return, I stayed in that spot. When an hour passed, I stayed. 2 hours. Lunch. the final school hour (it was about a 4 hours day back then). I know I was hungry and somewhere in there, I took a nap curled in a corner. I stayed and during dismissal, nearly 4 hours after initially finding my hiding spot, was when the nun realized I was missing--when my Dad became upset he couldn't locate me. When the headmaster (a priest) and the nun couldn't find me immediately, my Dad called the Military Police. The officer found me almost immediately and it took a lot of coaxing from him and my Dad to get me to come out. The minute I saw the nun, I started screaming again about the ruler and being hit. 

My dad immediately unenrolled me from the school. The school's contract was lost immediately with the Navy. No one sent their kids there after an investigation was started by CPS and the school was shut down about a month later. In the end, I didn't finish preschool and just went to kindergarten at the local public school when I hit the age. I do know that the nun was arrested on multiple counts of assault when it came out that the 20 kids in her class all received the same level of ruler punishment. 

TLDR: Teacher/nun used ruler on me because my skort was too short and I was too loud. School shut down and teacher arrested for multiple counts of assault, on 3 & 4 year olds."

My 6th grade science class,"BT:Bitch teacher
ME:ME
PO: All the popular kids
Ok so In 6th grade I had a teacher named mr gilly and he would make fun of me and some other non popular people and I have 3 story’s about him

1: So this is the one I was least pissed at but it still mad me mad So I had a teacher name mrs price and she gave me ISS(In school suspension)For not having the right binder and the day I get out of ISS He walks up to his then 11yr old student and said “Don’t piss me off today or your going back in ISS”

2:So I’m from a small city in Alabama and in this city the grades go as follows 
1-4 Elementary 
5-6 Middle
7-8 Jr high
9-12 Highschool
But In middle school up we have to tuck in our shirts and we like any school can’t have our phones out in class but one day kids in this class are chillin TAKING LITTERAL SELFIES WITH THE TEACHER and he rights me up for not having. My shirt tucked in And night I add I have science right after P.E! Yea I received 2 weeks ISS for that

3:This Pissed me off the most so he takes it upon himself to ruin the LITTERAL BEST DAY OF MY LIFE the day my step-dad adopted me by calling me a lazy fat idiot in front of the whole school Because i was not in 4th period science so I get up and I yell at him and I quote “I WAS BEING ADOPTED AT THE TIME 4TH PERIOD WAS GOING ON I DIDNT FUCKING GET HERE UNTIL 6TH PERIOD YOU MOTHERFUCKING BITCH WHO HAS THE AUDACITY TO MOCK ME LIKE YOU DID ON THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE GO SUCK A FUCKING DONKEY PENIS” and my dad was proud of me for standing up for myself and even had a few choice words for him himself.

"Class average is a 70% after the first three quizzes, teacher says he’s frustrated with our inability to retain information.... don’t think it’s our faults buddy lol check the kid with a 28.1% so far hahah",
The Purple Woman,"I had this teacher for three years: she thought a combination of Physics and Chemistry in 9th and 10th grade, and then just Chemistry in 12th grade.

This lady was purple all over: hair, clothes, accessories, her pen, her personal chalk, folders, papers, keychains, purses. Everything. She just loved the color. 

I started taking issue with her when I realized she was terrible at explaining things. She genuinely cared about Chemistry and had a passion for it, but it didn't translate into being a good teacher, especially since she barely knew any Physics but due to budget cuts I'm assuming she had to teach both.

She seemed to have some personal issues, and she would take it out on us. She constantly would accuse us of talking about her or laughing at her when we couldn't care less what she was doing. The situation was kind of alright in 9th grade, but the following year she seemed to have lost it further.

For the entire year she had outbursts where she would throw the chalk on the ground, pick it up and then slam it on the desk without saying anything. She would then move on to talk about whatever she was talking about. These incidents would come out of nowhere and were totally unprompted. She would also just fling the classroom door open, throw the chalk, walk out and either slam the door really loudly or just walk away for a certain amount of time (it was so unpredictable, it could be anywhere between 5 minutes to half an hour). She would again come back and resume talking about whatever. Sometimes she would do this multiple times in one day. She would scold kids in class for no reason and some of them would talk back and ask what they did. Her responses were either to shout at them that they knew what they did or just ignore them completely. 

A great example of her teaching method is that in 10th grade we were going over pressure in Physics. She's going over her explanations which make no sense and then asks us a question. ''Why can a submarine withstand huge pressure but a person cannot?''. I tune out and let the smart kids start to answer. They are giving actual explanations and she ignores every one. She tells them that the answer is incredibly obvious. ''A submarine is a thing and a person is a human''. That was her actual explanation. She loved using the word *thing* as a scientific explanation.

One of the kids in class decided to be a smart ass so he raised his hand to ask a question and asked, ''What about a cow surviving in the ocean?''. She slammed her hand on the desk and kicked him out for the rest of the class basically dragging him away by his shirt.

I usually got along with her fine until I decided to be done with her in the 9th grade. My homeroom teacher, who was pretty cool, came up to me and asked me if I was alright. She wanted to talk to me in private about how I was doing and if I was fitting in alright. I was new at this school, and this was a new country, so I just thought that she just wanted to check on me. But then she goes, ''A teacher came to me to tell me that you were acting depressed and had no friends. I don't get this impression when you are in my class so I wanted to check with you''. I asked if it was Purple Woman and she nodded in embarrassment. I was done at that point. I couldn't believe she made up her mind about me being depressed when I literally never gave any indications to that. It's just that I wasn't a piece of shit and kept my mouth shut in class, so she took me being relatively well behaved as me having no friends.

The following year she caught me talking quietly in class with someone and said in a condescending tone, ''My my, how you've changed''. I tried to avoid her as much as possible for those three years, which was rather difficult considering I had her at least 3 days a week, and in 12th grade it was 5 days a week. I just stayed quiet in class and didn't engage with her."
Emetophobia is means for suspension.,"I guess you can call this a bad teacher paired with a bad principal and a bad guidance counselor. This story happened when I was in the 4th grade.

I’m highly emetophobic and have been since I was very young. For those who aren’t aware, “emetophobia” is an extreme irrational fear of anything pertaining to vomit (sounds, sights, nauseous feelings, even the word sometimes sends me into a panic). I have a much better handle of it now after getting therapy, but it was a lot worse as a 10-year-old who had a hard time explaining my fears.

I remember my 4th grade teacher being very strict. One day during a lesson, a kid in my class had asked the teacher if he could go to the bathroom, to which her answer was no. She basically didn’t like kids leaving the classroom for whatever reason and would only allow bathroom breaks during recess. About 10 minutes later, the same kid asked again, but added “I don’t feel so good.” The teacher got angry and told him to stop making excuses to leave the lesson. However, the moment that kid said he didn’t feel so good, I immediately began my internal panic. I feel like I was the one who went physically white and I refused to look in that kid’s direction. I wasn’t paying attention, I went completely blank in the mind. I remember thinking on a mantra “omg please don’t please don’t please don’t” -----

And he did. Threw up right on his desk. I heard that noise, only looked for approximately .001 seconds, and BOLTED OUT THE CLASSROOM DOOR. I didn’t know what else to do, I had to just RUN, I had to get away from that entire situation, rational thinking was GONE.

I ran to the gym (which had a class going on at the time) and hid under the bleachers, hyperventilating and crying. I don’t remember if my teacher was the one who found me or not but I just remember being in the principal’s office while my teacher yelled at me for being disrespectful and I ended up with a 2-day out of school suspension. I also remember my mom being furious and trying to get that suspension off my record by explaining my phobia but it must not have worked because I definitely did that suspension. And right after serving my 2 days, I had to regularly see the guidance counselor about my “disruptive behavior tendencies.” And by that, I mean going to the guidance counselor’s office at my scheduled time 2 days a week only to sit in her empty office for 30 minutes, then leave because she was never actually THERE for my sessions.

Don’t worry, I started actual therapy by 6th grade."
The Worst Teacher I've Ever Had.,"**Note**: I'm new to Reddit and a friend suggested I post this story onto here. I made this account to say this. 

**Background:** I was a freshman, in a new school I never wanted to be in. I had many new teachers who treated everyone oh so nicely. However, like always, there was one teacher who stood out, Ms. F, the biology teacher. Ms. F had a somewhat positive aura to her on the first day of school, however, it quickly spiraled into someone who doesn't care about her job. On the second day of school, she has already started 3 projects and a planned test for next week. Keep in mind, this school isn't exactly perfect. Everybody did drugs, stole items, and fight, luckily, I didn't do any of that. 

  
The 3 projects never had an announced deadline yet, so everyone wasn't worrying about it. The only thing that seemed frightening was the test on the second week of school on a subject that wasn't taught to us yet. The test was on identifying skulls and how their movement was, what they eat, etc. We did work on it in class but she never did any clarification on anything, nor did she *ever* check in with us. There were 4 grades you could've gotten on the test: beginning, approaching, meeting and exceeding if you didn't get at least a meeting, you had to retake the test. When the test came, my brain was completely dead, I tried my hardest on the test, however, when the test came back I got an ""approaching"" grade. I was pretty bummed out by this because, in the second week, I've already failed biology. When I looked around the classroom to see the grades of others, I was shocked to find out nobody has gotten anything above ""approaching"". I was waiting for the announcement that she was wrong and could've done her teaching better but that never came. I sat there, in a false hope, wondering when she would tell us that we didn't have to retake the test and she would just teach better. She never did. 

  
Now the test was over, and because we didn't have any deadlines announced to us yet, we were relaxed and scheduling when we can retake this test. The first deadline that was announced was the week after the test on Monday at the beginning of class, which wasn't too hard, finished the project, simple. On Monday, the supposed due date, she didn't collect it. She didn't go near the idea we had a project due on that day. A few weeks later, she asks the class why we didn't turn in our projects, even after the class explained what happened to her, she marked all our work down for being late when it was her fault. The second project was on animals we were researching, and we needed to explain how the ""7 Laws of Nature"" applies to it. Since nobody could find it online (because anything you searched up just leads to meditation or whatever), we couldn't work on it at home (I also don't know why I didn't just write down the information...) so we had a lot of class-time to work on it. We were told certain dates to work in class, about 3 times a week for 2 weeks. When those dates came, needless to say, we didn't get to work on the project. Everyone did a half-assed job and we suffered greatly. The last project was just canceled, forgot about, and she just brushed it off when someone brought up the topic to her. I hated the class and the school, so I basically did my absolute best to transfer, and luckily, I got into a different school.

  
Finally, I want to tell you about she treated me (before I transferred to another school). As I mentioned earlier, everyone at our school isn't perfect and maybe the furthest thing from being perfect. However, I forgot to mention that they're incredibly loud, to the point where their voices were disrupting other teachers on break to the point where they called security classes. Ms. F's class had a class full of these kids, which was also the class I was in. A huge reason why I'm making this post was because of the way I was treated. Ms. F always harassed me for being too loud or too disruptive whenever I raised my voice even slightly, while the student next to her is streaming their head off trying to talk to someone else from across the class.

Ask me anything you're still curious about"
Bad teacher,So this happened  along  time ago in Class  when i was younger. The teacher  was teaching  and someone  needed  help with what ever we were doing so she was helping  that person  when one of the students said that she felt  like  she  was  going  to  throw up. The teacher  didnt do anything  and just   ignored  her  or maybe  said wait i dont really  remember but she keep  saying  that she felt she was going  to  throw up  and alot of other students  including  me were saying  she was going  to  throw up. I really  think she just ignores  us all but when she finally  was going to help the girl that was going  to  throw  up  it was to late and she threw up and it smelt so bad everyone  had to get out of the classroom and wait for the janitor to clean  it. She should  have  listened to  us but yea thats what happened  to  me in class along  time  ago.
French Teacher Embarrasses Me For Taking French,"I ended up moving countries and schools in 9th grade, which is when this happened. Thankfully I only had this teacher for one day but it was enough for me.

When my parents were signing me up for school, they were told I needed to choose an optional class (choices were French, Religion or extra Math). They were told that Math was full so between Religion and French they figured I'd prefer French.

First day of class rolls around and the teacher begins the usual introduction and asks everyone to say a couple of words about themselves. I had never taken French, ever. My turn comes up and I explain that this is actually my first time taking French and I was not able to introduce myself yet. I'm also doing this in another language as I'm now in a different country and this is already stressful for me.

She proceeds to be OUTRAGED that I was in the class saying: ''I can't believe you're here!!'', ''You've NEVER taken French?'', ''How are you supposed to do ANYTHING in this class???''. She then laughed at me and asked if I was sure where I was. Everyone was staring at me at that point, as I was not only a new kid, I was from a different country and apparently didn't know what class I had signed up for.

The class lasted 50 minutes and the whole time she kept making passive aggressive comments and asking me if I could read. I was perfectly fine keeping up in the class, since they spent 50 minutes going over pronouns, so apparently the class wasn't as advanced as she thought.

At the end of the class she comes up to me again with her hands on her hips and just says, ''I don't know what I'm gonna do with you''. I bolt out of there and go straight to my homeroom teacher who was very cool. 

I explain the situation to her and I tell her that I DO NOT want to go back to that class. She's a little flustered and isn't sure if there is anything she can do, since that's the class my parents signed off on. But because she was very cool she talked to the office and managed to get me into extra Math (which was awesome!!), since they totally had openings and the office just didn't know what they were talking about. So I got to have extra hours of my favorite subject, and extra time to do homework and get better grades in Math.

A couple of years later, there were some cutbacks in the educational budget, so schools started letting some teachers go. My school decided to have an exam for the teachers and let them go based on their scores. Both the Religion and French teachers were let go because they were unable to pass the basic exams (I believe 6 teachers total failed their own classes). 

So it turned out that the French teacher didn't even know  French."
Economics Teacher Gets Fired,"This happened in 9th grade, and thankfully I had this teacher for less than a year since I ended up moving countries and changing schools.

The very first day of class he straight up tells us that he doesn't want to use a textbook because ''they are all terrible and not one single person actually understands Economics''. So instead, we would use his book, as he was apparently the Chosen One ans was the only person in history (his words) to understand the subject. We thought he would make us go out and actually purchase the book he published, but he insisted on dictating it to us every class. So I'm pretty sure the dude hadn't actually published anything and was lying.

Every day for two hours (we had double classes) he would dictate notes to us, but not in a concise or clear way, but he would just ramble and we would have to follow. That meant that he would speak at a normal or even fast pace, and we would have to practically break our hands to write down what he was saying. He also wouldn't allow us to ask him to repeat himself, or ask a classmate for a specific word, which meant we had to ask each other after class and waste time to decipher our messy handwriting. Also, since he didn't plan his lessons beforehand (because why would he, right), what he said made no sense and didn't follow any structure.

The dictating method would continue during exams as well. He wouldn't print an exam or write the questions on the board, he would dictate the questions one by one. This would have been fine if they were questions that required short or long answers, but he wanted the exam to be a test. He also didn't want us copying off of each other, so he would create 4 different versions and distribute them according to the four columns of seats in class. This meant that he would dictate question 1, option a, option b, option c and option d for exam type A, and then move on to do the same for all four types and all 25 questions. We would literally write the exams ourselves as he was making up questions on the spot (the majority didn't even make sense). Because the exams didn't make sense as he didn't plan them out beforehand, they were very, very, very difficult and the answers didn't match the questions sometimes. He kept failing the entire class and then making us grovel for our grades.

I ended up moving countries and got away from him but my former classmates stayed until the end of the year. They barely managed to pass. However, I kept in touch with them and they told me that the next year the teacher had been fired.

The reason he had been fired was because he was blackmailing seniors. Apparently three girls from the 12th grade reported him after he threatened to fail them if they did not give them money (about 1000 EUR). Not only did he want money, he wasn't even offering good grades. In this country the grades go from 2 to 6 and you need at least a 3 to pass which is awful. He was offering a 3.5 for an absurd amount of money. The girls had enough at the end of the year and reported him, and it was revealed that he had been doing that for years with students that had been too scared to report him. 

Guess he messed with the wrong people that time."
Bad financial literacy,"We have only been in school for three weeks and my teacher Ms.T told the class she was illegal for 10 years and worked a hard job, i dont personally know why i need to know this. We also previously had a culture project due, to being a family relic to class or to take a picture. Im in the 11th grade and shes incompitent and shes having us to personal warm-ups like todays ""If My Teacher Knew"" and i feel this is irrelivant for my financial literacy class. We have only been in our textbook once and we do warm ups every day, advice?"
My teacher failed my friend for not putting the last letter of his last name.,
Sexist and Resentful Ethics/Philosophy Teacher,"I had this teacher for two years, both 10th and 11th grade. She taught Ethics the first year and Philosophy the second year.

In 10th grade we didn't have as many issues with her at first. She was an older woman and had broken her arm at the start of the school year, so we got a substitute who was absolutely lovely and encouraged healthy discussions and debates in class. She left after a few weeks and we expected the class to continue on as usual, but we were mistaken.

Our regular teacher steps in and immediately tells us she will not be following the established curriculum because she feels it is not needed. She only wants to focus on equality. We're like ok...we can roll with that (even though our textbooks that we spent money on were now completely useless). Turns out equality for her meant that women were better than men. Her entire class for the year was comprised of comments such as ''Men shouldn't get custody of children in divorces because they don't love their children as much'', ''There is no such thing as bad mothers'', ''Men never develop emotionally'' and so on and so forth. We were willing to put up with the comments as long as it didn't affect our grades. However, we started seeing that after every exam, every single girl would get a good grade even without studying and every single boy would fail. It became such an obvious pattern and we honestly didn't know how to deal with it. The girls wanted to help the boys because we felt guilty not studying and passing, and the boys were desperate to fix this situation. They would try to talk to the teacher about their grades and she would just say ''You boys just don't get the material, and I don't expect you to since you are males''. They had to study a lot more, do more assignments, and grovel at the end of the year just to get a barely passing grade.

Moving on to 11th grade, we figured the situation would be the same again. However, instead of Ethics, she was now teaching Philosophy and completely dropped the equality/women are better than men mindset. Instead, she spent the entire year being resentful of the success her younger sister has. She spent a lot of time talking about how her sister went to a good college in the US, how she is now a respected professor there, and how she has a lot of published works. However, she didn't tell stories like she was proud of her sister, but more like how everyone paid more attention to her and this 60+ year old woman was not over it.

Again, we chose to put up with her comments as long as they weren't actually affecting our grades. As far as teaching, she was actually following the curriculum so we figured things would be better. Again, we were wrong.

The first exam rolls around, it's pretty standard, there's nothing difficult about it. However, every single person fails. She says she's disappointed in us and can't believe we didn't understand the material. Before the exam she had told us she didn't want us to memorize the textbook and instead wanted us to tell the material in our own way, which is understandable. But after doing that, she failed us because what we wrote in the exam ''wasn't what was said in the textbook''. Ok, we decide to talk about what to do next and she agrees that for the next exam, we should just write what is in the textbook so there are no misunderstandings.

The second exam of the year rolls around and we fail again. Why, you ask. She says she doesn't like what is written in the textbook, and doesn't like the way the material is presented, so she doesn't want to use it anymore. Ok, so the textbooks we paid a lot of money for are once again discarded. To avoid any more issues, we agree that she will dictate our notes for the remainder of the year, and we will literally write her own words in the exam as if we are learning to write in 1st grade.

You'd think that she'd be happy to do it this way, as we would just be repeating what she said like parrots. Third exam rolls around and guess what. We fail again. And when I say ''we'' I mean the entire class, not just people that didn't study or she didn't like.

She says she doesn't understand what is going on and that we are such a difficult class. Lady, if 36 people are failing and don't know why, the issue may be with you. She says she never said the things we wrote on the exam.

I kid you not, like 7 people stand up and take their notebooks to her to show her the notes she dictated like two weeks ago. He response is ''I never said this, you're lying''. Our response is ''36 people wrote down the same thing, it's not like 1 person is making it up to save themselves''. She comes back with ''You planned this'' and eventually goes to ''You all misunderstood me''.

Needless to say, we all had to do extra assignments, take make up exams and basically beg for a passing grade at the end of the year.

Thankfully she ended up retiring the next year, so no other students were harmed after us."
"My HASS teacher is a racist, A homophobe and a basic bully.","My History teacher singled out an Aboriginal girl and expected her to know everything about Uluru. She stepped out of class crying and he didn't do anything about it. During a different history lesson, we were talking about different landscapes and somehow the lesson changed for a few seconds to about transgender people. He said ""Transgender people. I know. Weird"" and then he also said ""And gays and bisexual people"", and that offended me because I'm bisexual (Nobody else knows yet). And finally, the teacher will literally put our names on the board and keep us in after class if we talk for 0.01 seconds. Like someone will look like they are talking so the teacher instantly assumes that they are and will put their name on the board to basically tell them ""Stay in after class"". Everyone hates this teacher. Also, I forgot to mention that he literally brought a camera to class to record our behavior and show to the school board. One girl in my class has mad stress issues so she said to him ""I don't want to be in a class where I'm recorded without my consent"", but the teacher said that he doesn't care. One of my classmates told the teacher that one of us could legally sue him for recording us without our permission and that student got in trouble. Like frick. I thought my strict AF math teacher was bad before this guy became my teacher. Also, he never warns us about tests EVER and he expects us to instantly know when we have a test. We don't even have a curricular sheet that lets us know when every test occurs."
My teacher is a racist,"I don't know if this belongs here, (or even makes him a racist) but here goes nothing. I'm a freshman and my first period teacher is strict as all hell about phones, here's the thing though, he'll only get on about phones if someone with color uses them. My friend (A white male) commonly and publicly uses his phone during class. Whenever any other students of color uses there phone for less than a second, he will immediately take them away or take them down to SRO. Now he'll also criticize anything and everything about a persons paper if they're colored, while if you're white you're able to write a six word essay and he won't blink an eye. I don't know man, sounds pretty whack."
“Do you want me to kiss your foot to make you feel better?”,"Key:
Principal= P
Teacher = T

This is gonna be a long one so buckle up for the ride.
In my gym class we had about 20 exercise stations to complete. Me and a couple other of my friends took our shoes off and went in socks to complete the exercises (The exercises were easier to do in my opinion). One the stations I had to complete was one where you squatted down, picked up a medicine ball, threw the ball up in the air and let it fall. So I did exactly that, however, the ball landed on my foot... The medicine ball was 15 and a half pounds (7kg) Listen, I’m a very tough cookie when it comes to injury so I decided to try and tough it out and get an ice pack after class. Until we got to the next station... The next station was lunges and I couldn’t put pressure on my left foot. It hurt too bad every time I tried. I felt my foot starting to swell so I called over T.
Me: “T I need an ice pack for my foot, I dropped the medicine ball on it.”
T: “You only have a few stations left you’ll be fine”
Me: “I can’t do these exercises T, my foot is starting to swell and I can put pressure on it.”
T looked me up and down and walked away. I turned to my friend and I said “Look, she doesn’t even care.” That’s when the whole ball game changed.
T walked over to me and said in a babyish tone: “Do you want me to kiss your foot to make you feel better?” All while trying to grab my injured foot off of the floor to “kiss” it.
A little fact about me: I am extremely argumentative and never did tolerate disrespectful behavior from ANYONE. I tried to keep my cool with this woman just to save myself from any trouble. 
Me: “That’s really rude, don’t ever try to look like you’re going to put your hands on me though, all I wanted was an ice pack.”
T: “Yeah ok I’ll get you an ice pack alright?”
We both agreed she’d get me an ice pack and after 10 minutes, she hasn’t even attempted to get me an ice pack. My foot is still throbbing in pain and I can feel like getting worse by the second. I. Am. Livid.
Me: “T I’M NOT GONNA WAIT AROUND ANY GOD DAMN LONGER, I’M LEAVING TO GO TO THE NURSE AND NEXT TO SEE P”
I limped shoeless all the way down to the nurses office, they gave me an ice pack, and so I started my limping journey down to P’s office. I walk into to see the secretary and my friend talking. The look on my face was pure rage. I broke down angry crying and proceeded to tell this story. The poor secretary had me sit in a “calm down” room. After 10 minutes go by of me icing my foot and “calming down” I tell the secretary that I need my backpack and my shoes, which T has. I hear the conversation through the walkie talkie.
Secretary: “T, can you send A STUDENT(very important for what’s about to come) with OP’s belongings down to the office”
T: “Sure”
It’s a far walk from the gym to the office where I am. I’m pretty much calm but I’m still very easy to piss off. That’s when I hear T’s voice walk into the office after the secretary specifically told her for a STUDENT to send my stuff down. T slams my things down next to me and says in the same baby voice “Awww OP is your foot okay?”
Me: “Please leave”
T *obviously sarcastic*: “I just wanna make sure that you’re okay”
Me: “I will be when you leave”
T: “There’s no need to be rude” 
Me: “That’s ironic”
T: “Okay well I’m sorry that YOU hurt your foot”
Me *livid yet again*: “Like I said get the hell away from me. PLEASE try to put your hands on me again and I will backhand the ever living shit out of you, Mark my words” 
T leaves. I get out my phone and I call my mom. My mom is a very long tempered woman, it takes a lot to sink the ship. But as soon as my story was finished, I can hear the anger in my moms voice when she said,
“I’ll be there in 20 minutes.”
Mom: “Where is OP and where the fuck is P”
The secretary tells my mom that P is in a meeting but she directed to where I was sitting. We wait for what seemed like forever until P got back. Me and my mom both told P EVERYTHING. P is a very straightforward person and tells us that she’s on our side completely and her actions won’t go without punishment. P said that this district cares for their students and this occurrence was something that would not sit well with the administration.
I left school early to get my foot x-rayed and came back the next day to have a new class put in to replace T and her gym class. My foot was broken, Fuck you T."
Absolutely Insane Substitute Teacher,"No jokes, I had a teacher that was way past eccentric. I have so many stories about him, I'll see how many I remember. Bare in mind this was in the late 90s, early 2000s, in a grammar school in the UK. It was all boys, strict and had good grade averages so the atmosphere was serious and dorky.

Let's call the teacher Mr. Batty.,

1. **The sudden scream**. We were in a maths lesson, he was covering. His job is to assign the work left by the teacher, which we do in silence and he keeps an eye on us. So it was, very quiet, we were all working, he was wondering around the class. People would occasionally talk to eachother in whispers, it wasn't the end of the world, but we were supposed to be being quiet and working on problems.Out of the blue, the calm silence is interrupted by Mr. Batty screaming at the Top. Of. His. Lungs. ""STOP. TALKINGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" He was shouting as loud as someone being devoured alive by a lion might be shouting.The insane part of this though, was what he had done. He had snuck up behind these two kids who had probably been whispering, was right behind their heads, and inch away, when he opened up the avalanche of angry noise right in their ears. They hadn't seen him sneak up and it scared the crap out of them.
2. **The weird play**. This time in German class, he's covering and we had some stuff to do, which we were supposed to bring to the front of the class and give to him when done. He was furiously working on something of his own.People who had just handed in their work were returning with funny looks on their faces. At some point I got curious so I went and handed something in. What I saw was really creepy. He was writing a weird play. IIRC, it went something like this:  
*-Mr. Bunny Flufflekins: Hello Doctor CuddleMuffin, isn't it a fine day today?*  
*-Doctor CuddleMuffin: Why yes, it is a fine day today, Mr. Flufflekins. How is your wife?*  
*-Mr. Bunny Flufflekins: I am glad you asked! She is doing splendid, Doctor CuddleMuffin, the medicine you are giving here is really helping with the rash.*  
etc. Like, writing something like that, where everyone could see. Sort of wanting them to see it. I don't know.
3. **The photos**. This one I heard from a friend, so might be exaggerated. Apparently during one of the lessons he covered for him, he was bragging about how he had just been to Australia. He then proceeded to pull out photos of all the animals he had hunted and killed. Crocodiles, Kangaroos etc. If you bare in mind what type of school we were in and all that etc. this was probably inappropriate, not to mention pretty creepy.
4. **General insanity**. He generally would be seen talking to himself, dancing, telling people off really suddenly over weird things or nothing, and all kinds of crazy stuff.

If I remember anything else he did, I will edit and add it, and bare in mind it's been so long that my memory may have embellished these stories a bit, as is always the case for people recounting stories from years ago.

It's just so weird that he was still in that school for years and years. If you think that he probably covered hundreds of lessons in those times, and I only had him a few times and have this many stories... I don't remember the last time I saw him, but wow, he certainly made for some good stories. I like to think that he just had a really strange sense of humour, there is a sense of prankishness to all the stuff he pulled on us stiff, up tight, dorky kids and I am glad he made things a bit more entertaining in our fairly boring schooling xD"
Teacher didn't get a joke,"So this is a classic from when I was in my first or second year of secondary school (i.e. high school). TL;DR at the end. Let me set the scene.

It was a boys' grammar school (meaning you need to do a test to get in, and it had very good grades at the time, late 90s and early 2000s), with uniform, strict and serious environment in the UK, with quite a bit in common with Hogwarts.

My favourite subject was science, and we were in a chemistry lesson. It was already getting dark outside, being in the deep of the UK winter, and the mood was relaxed. Our teacher was a fairly jovial middle aged man we will call Mr. Richards. 12 year old me, with my silly sense of humour, felt the mood was right to put my hand up and ask if I could tell a joke. There might have been a couple exchanged before.

Now please, don't judge me by this joke. I was 12, had recently heard it, thought it was clever and funny, and thought it could get a giggle from the class... here goes:

""I used to think the brain was the best part of the body. But then I realised....*look who's telling me that!*"" badum tish.

Yawn! Well, I was expecting a laugh. What was really funny though, was what actually happened.

Mr. Richards immediately goes bright red. He was balding, and literally, his whole head went a very vivid red. It was so bright that it is burned in the film of my memory. He then started shouting at me, at the very very top of his lungs, as loud as a person can possibly shout, enough to make him go from bright red to dark purple. ""DO YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?! GET. OUT!""

Little 12 year old me, terrified start to leave with shaking hands. ""NO, TAKE ALL YOUR STUFF"". Ok, I grab it and go and wait outside, shaking like a bed in a cheap motel. I had got in a bit of trouble in primary school, and I was told off by my dad, and was scared to get in trouble again, especially in such a strict school and important school. But for the life of me, I couldn't fathom what I possibly could have done.

Can you? See if you can work it out before reading on.

&#x200B;

...

&#x200B;

Well he came out eventually, sat me at a desk and told me, still fuming, that I had to stay out here for the rest of the lesson. Then proceeded to write the absolute longest ""bad note"" in my diary. After I read it, I knew what he thought. ""*look who's telling me that*"". He thought I was mocking him, as my science teacher, for teaching me that my brain is the best part of the body or something. I know, it doesn't really make sense... Maybe he had just made his own joke, or mentioned something about the brain being the best part of the body which is what reminded me of the joke? I honestly can't remember. Still, I think the whole thing was absolutely hilarious, in hindsight, but I was already feeling a bit relieved when I knew what had happened because it was definitely a misunderstanding, anyone would see that.

I got sent to the head of year, let's call him Mr. Broughton (you never got sent to the headmaster in this school, you'd have to do something pretty extreme for that). He was someone who was head of years 1 and 2, and whenever he addressed us, it was always in a very fear inspiring way. He came across as someone who will punish you severely, and you *don't* want to get in trouble with.

When he called me in, he had a wry smile on his face, knowing that I hadn't done anything wrong and it was all a quite embarrassing misunderstanding.  The truth is, he did the whole strict year head thing as an act, and the moment you got out of years 1 and 2, especially if you ended up with him teaching you a subject, he would explain he puts it on to get people in the right spirit for the school when they first start, but really he's a really chilled guy. I got to find out early when he just told me to not make jokes in class (something that became more normal eventually as you got older in the school) and let me off with a slap on the wrist. It did feel great for 12 year old me to feel I had made a nice and humorous connection with the head of the year (although we didn't interact much after that as I never had him as a teacher).

Things were never quite the same with Mr. Richards. Good thing is, I ended up being the best kid in physics in my year by year 4, a bit of a favourite among the science department, so things got nicely healed in the end (until I got to 6th form, when my biology teacher developed an unexplained hatred of me, but that's another story) and I have lots of fond memories from that school.

Well there's my story, glad I have something to contribute to the great wide world of reddit. If you can think of any other good subs that would enjoy this story, feel free to let me know in the comments.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Tell the following joke in chemistry class: ""I used to think the brain was the best part of the body. But then I realised....*look who's telling me that!*"", teacher thinks I am talking about him and sends me out class, screaming at me. Get sent to head of year who figures out what happened and lets me off with a wry smile."
My horrible math teacher,"Hello folks!First post here,I wanted to explain my shitty math teacher.So she has a very heavy accent which isn’t bad but it makes it’s very hard to learn because of how hard it is to understand her.Oh did I mention she called my best friend stupid?That made him  really sad as he’s smart,almost as smart as I am.Got me framed for something I didn’t do and much more.Well bye folks and thanks for reading my post"
My H.PE Teacher Sucks,"So I was in grade 7 and the P.E was my period 1 class, first off, I forgot my hat so I have a detention because the other H.P.E teacher (who’s class we work with) always gave out detentions to students without hats so of course the one day my teacher thinks “yeah I’ll copy him and give detentions to people without their hats” was the day I forgot my hat. This isn’t the main chunk of the story but you can see that it already starts off bad. We normally just pick our volleyball teams but today was near the end of the term so my teacher decides to put us in groups and so he starts calling out names of pre-made teams and it is so f*cking obvious that the teams are skill based, so all the students who are good at volleyball go into the 1st team, the next best people are the 2nd team and so on, but I get put in the second last team (which was to be expected I was a nerd back in grade 7, not that good at sport) but then this little c*nt decides to demote me to the last team without questions, he’s just like “oh you guys don’t have enough people? (my name) you can join this team!” And that crushing feeling when you so obviously get put in an absolute trash team (because my team were just people who were bad at volleyball, but THIS team was people who couldn’t give a f*ck about any of their grades) is horrible. The worst part is he acts like no one knows that these teams are tiered in skill and it’s so f*cking annoying. Now that I’m demoted, my will to play has been completely crushed. Playing with this team and ESPECIALLY against the other team was absolutely f*cking horrendous, like REALLY REALLY bad. My teacher had also said at the start of the lesson that “today is your last chance to prove that you have a better grade than what I’ve marked you at right now” But this little prick DOESN’T GIVE A F*CK ABOUT US, you can so obviously tell that our section of the court is just the trashy kids who are gonna get D and E’s so don’t look at them, so I’m working my f*cking ass of to try and get promoted up to a court with kids who have half a brain cell, BUT YOU KNOW ITS KINDA F*CKING HARD WHEN THE TEACHER DOESNT GIVE A RAT’S ASS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR TEAM! And then at the end of the period he comes up to us and says (I f*cking quote) “You need to try harder if you want to get a good grade on your report card” AND IM JUST LIKE EXCUSE ME F*CKHEAD? YOU’RE THE ONE WHO COULDN’T CARE LESS ABOUT US, DIDN’T LOOK AT OUR SKILL, EFFORT OR BEHAVIOUR ONCE AND KNOWINGLY PUT US IN A GARBAGE TEAM AND NOW YOU’RE SAYING THAT WE NEED TO TRY HARDER, MAYBE MY TEAM, BUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE SETTING, DIGGING AND SERVING 95% OF THE TIME WHILE THESE GUYS WERE TALKING IN THE BACK. Somehow I get put we these absolutely clueless pieces of living trash, while people who are worse than me are in the second to last team. What the actual f*ck."
I hate my drama teacher,"I always loved being stage crew and the drama class I enrolled to said they do stage crew training. Sorry for bad grammar because a am an idiot.

roles BDT= bad drama teacher ME=ME  H= Hannah G=Grant C= Caleb

So on to the story

I just switched schools from Ravenscroft to Trinity Academy  and I love it more than Ravenscroft so on my our first day of class this happened 

BDT: ""you can quietly talk to your peers""

Class: \*starts talking quietly\*

BDT: ""I don't remember letting you guy talk""

G: ""you said 'you can quietly talk to your peers' Right?""

BDT: ""Do I need to send you to Mr.Reneri (our principle)

: Next Day :

So we had to do a pantomime unit ( basically acting but without props or words)

My partner for the pantomime was H, ANYWAYS its the end of the unit so the teacher grades us on how well our performance was the rubric was based on our skit, not on our acting 

1=bad 

2= so and so 

3= meh 

4= Good

H got a 98 and I got an 83.  I have no clue on how she gave me an 83 and H 98 

so I was showing C and G my grade and H mine 

Me: ""How and why did she give me an 83 and H a 98""

H: ""I think she might be biased with women""

C: "" That's called being sexist H""

G: "" you should go up to the BDT and say that you got a bad grade""

Me: ""No, She will bring my grade even lower"" 

{That's all I really have and I will try to post more about BDT classes (She is not as bad as the art teacher SHE SPENT 45 MINUTES TALKING ABOUT BOATS) i will post more if more bad things happen}"
Let’s talk about my choir teacher,"Ok so I’m in high school now (not going to say which grade), but when I was in 8th grade I took choir and ooooohhhhh boy let me tell you guys about this abusive horrible person.  I hear you typing oh how bad could she have been, your probably over reacting, well no so hold ur thumbs and listen to my stories. 

Ok so let’s call her Mrs. Martinez (not her real name). so when I walked into that class on the first day of school I thought it was going to be a cool class because there was only 9 people in the entire class, ( that’s important later). so this teacher would have regular breakdowns, and I know that doesn’t sound that bad, I don’t know what was going on at her home so it could have been for a good reason. Although when you start calling students shitty kids and disrespectful for talking when she said we could. Or for getting water while we were on break then you cross the line but that isn’t the worst of it. She chose three people for some random reason and berated is constantly it was me my friend Lauren and Gemma. Gemma got the worst of it to the point where the teacher would make her cry openly in class, and Gemma had told us that she had cried at home too and at one point I decided fuck it this isn’t right we have to report her to the principal. So the three of us went to the counselor because the principal was never anywhere to be found and told her about what had been happening to us. There know you know everything you need to know about for me to tell you what happened next.


Me:mega erection. L:Lauren. G:Gemma. T:teacher 




So we walked into class and the teacher was late so we all sat down in our assigned spots.the teacher bursted through the door and...


T: ok who the heck reported me to the counselor!

(My whole class was just facing forward and she was behind us) 

T: well who was it! You might as well tell me because I have an appointment with the principal and I’m just going to ask her. She’ll tell me!

( that is very wrong when you go to the counselor it is super confidential and they aren’t allowed to tell anyone)

M:(quietly to Lauren) fuck it I’m going to tell her it was me so she’ll shut up.

L:no don’t do it you’ll get in trouble.

M:fuck it I’m so done I don’t care.

G:m no don’t 

( I then stood up and turned around to face the teacher) 

M: you know what T it was me I reported you because you consistently stop class for your breakdowns. Which I can handle but you make Gemma cry every week.

T:I’m giving you a referral!

M: do it I haven’t done anything wrong. If I’m suspended I’ll spend my days eating ice cream watching 

T:tries to slap me.

M: grabs her hand before she can touch me.

she then fell on her desk and cried. She called the office to send an aide to replace her as she was too emotionally distraught to teach. You should know the aides help the disabled kids. So when she got over herself and went on the aide got there she just sent the aide back waisting valuable time the aide could have used to help disabled kids. 


Sorry if the grammar is bad English isn’t my first language and I’m on mobile. Ask any questions you have down in the comments below. Mods don’t take me down none of the names are real."
a teacher yelled at my friend because his paper airplane was bad. this is in year 7.,
Math Is Easy,"Ok, so I totally loved Math when I was in school and I've never been a fan of the whole ''Math sucks and it's hard'' movement. However, I almost failed in 11th grade, along with my entire class.

Our teacher in 11th grade was terrible at explaining. We just couldn't understand anything she was saying even though we were paying attention. We would ask her to explain something a few times to us, and she would give the same explanation over and over again without making it easier or more understandable in any way. Then she would just laugh at us and say that it's easy so she doesn't understand why we are not getting it.

It got to the point where were were begging her to give us extra homework so we could practice and she didn't want to bother with it. After begging for a few days (we had Math for two hours almost every day, I was in a Science oriented major in high school), she finally caved in a gave us close to 100 exercises and were actually excited about doing homework. We all hand in our papers in a couple of days and she says, ''No, no need to hand them in. I won't be correcting them''. What? ''Yeah, I'm sure you guys did well''. We have to beg her again to take the papers and correct them and she accepts after a bit. Fast forward two weeks later, and she gives us our homework back and she's corrected about 6 or 7 exercises for each person. We're all like wtf?? She says, ''I've corrected a few problems, so I'm sure you can figure out the rest on your own''.

At this point, the entire class is failing, I mean every single person. If it had been just the people that were bad at Math or the people that didn't bother studying I would understand. But literally not one person passed her exam. She held a make up exam and ONE PERSON PASSED. That was me, thanks to my private tutor. I honestly felt bad for my classmates that I was the only one that managed a passing grade (barely, 6/10). 

I had to pay to go to a private tutor just so she could explain to me the basics of integrals and I could finish the problems with her. I ended up going to that tutor for the remainder of the year and passed thanks to her with a not so bad grade considering our teacher.

I ended up having a lot of difficulties in 12th grade, and ended up failing the class at the end of the year (but I did manage to pass in September after studying all summer)."
College Admissions Class ended after 1 year.,"r/slash is a wonderful relaxer and during it, I listen to him often. Now, one of his stories got me thinking about high school--and this horrid college admission teacher/counselor my school hired. 

When I was in 12th grade, my school hired this lady to be our college counselor/admission's teacher. She was supposed to prepare us for college by teaching us how to write essays for admission, how to apply for financial aid, how to do testing, ect. As this school was a college prep school, her class was near mandatory unless as a senior, you somehow got your parents to sign you out of it. 

Add to this the absolute hatred that flowed off this woman like freaking waves. She Hated Teaching Essay writing. She hated teaching financing for college. She HATED our resident state. She HATED her job. She HATED us (high school juniors and seniors). She made it known. She would constantly say harsh and cruel things to us students.  

'You won't go to college"", ""You will never go to a college in this state"", ""4 year, ha! You will be lucky to go to anything after this place"", ""your too stupid for school after high school""  were very often comments made by this woman. 

This was a private school that prided itself on sending students to 4 year BIG NAME universities and Colleges. Our school was evaluated on a different level and our regular classes were considered like taking AP or college level (some of us did go to local college classes too). ANYWAY, being told this repeatedly got VERY annoying and upsetting, especially for academically driven students like myself. I was determined to go to a 4 year of my choice and in my home state. This lady was determined to beat us students down. 

Now something the school implemented to get students ""excited"" for the class was this strange acceptance check. Basically, the school would gift the student the application fee if they produced a letter of acceptance. Now, I don't know how many have done applications, but college apps in my state were and to my knowledge still not cheap. I talked it out with my Dad and after revealing exactly what was being said, was given the go ahead for this little payback lesson and the free-for-all sign in my application process.  Dad later confessed, he saw it as a win-win. Teach a cruel teacher a lesson and ensure his child had the confidence she needed to go to school and overcome a challenging obstacle. The school had that strange acceptance letter check they back paid for acceptance letter--but they never actually put a limit on how many letters you could turn in. A loophole I found and barged a truck through. 

I still remember the admins face when I showed up on the first day of the new semester with ***8*** acceptance letters.....I walked away with a nice check and a nice time talking to admin about why I felt the need to apply to ***8*** different schools because ""I was so frightened about not getting into any school as told by my teacher"". I then informed the admin that there maybe other students so stressed they felt a need for multiple apps because of things our teacher kept saying. I also handed over a note excusing me from the college prep course for the remainder of the year from my Dad. When I was walking out of the room, in walked the #3 student of the senior class, with about 5 acceptance letters. We exchanged smirks as he caught the loophole too and nodded at me... 

They cancelled the class the following year. By the second semester, all but 2 seniors had dropped her course and gotten parental intervention. She was let go that year too. Never heard of her since. 

TLDR: School teacher says high schoolers will never get into college--they do go to college and use loopholes in program to have school pay for them getting accepted into colleges."
"It doesn’t matter if he has Tourette’s, I’m the teacher.","Already posted this to entitled people, but someone suggested I post this here too.

So I don’t know if this really fits here, but my little brother suffers from a neurological condition called Tourette’s syndrome and has since he’s been diaganosed since about 4.

Now he had a lot of older friends because me and my sister let him stay with us and our friends because he found it hard to make friends with kids his age as a few bullied him and the rest kind of alienated him. 

Now there was a teacher Mrs k. (Ironic cause Karen starts with k and she was one.) who was and entitled woman. She didn’t take a lot of peoples personal lives into consideration and if you were down she was having a worse day than you almost always and would have a fight to figure out why she is much better than you and deserves sympathy over you. 

Not a lot of people liked her. 

Now my little brother unfortunately had her class. Now all the teachers and staff were aware that he had some problems and suffered from Tourette’s. 

She didn’t care, claimed he was “faking” his tics and problems. (Idk how you can fake a diagnosed neurological condition but) to sum it up one of his tics when he has a bad day is he makes a sound a lot like a chipmunk squeak and constantly looks up or flicks his head upward.

Now I didn’t find out the rest til I saw him at home but he had been sent home early for “class disruption” 

When what had actually happened was that his tics were acting up and the teacher started yelling at him he started crying. She had called him a dumbass and retard in front of everyone and made her class laugh and than sent him to the office when his tics wouldn’t stop because if you don’t know there are certain triggers that make the tics worse. His happens to be anxiety and high stress. 

So naturally they got worse after she made the class laugh at him and berated him. So she felt the need to send him to the office and send him home. 

Of course the school had hell to pay when my mom found out and than when they tried to not remove him from her class. 

She claimed she didn’t understand Tourette’s and that in that way it didn’t matter. 

My whole point is this lady was so entitled she decided that a kid with a neurological condition was the perfect person to pick on, berate, and make fun of to a class of children and than send home because it was his fault. 

Like the nerve of this lady. Honestly this isn’t the only horror story with her tbh."
No other religions in my class!,"Hello, I hope this is okay if it talks of religion. So, first a little context. When I was in 1st grade, I attended a charter school with my two older sisters. Keep in mind that this school was not affiliated with any religion. My first grade teacher was probably a minor demon. At the beginning of the year, she established a zero tolerance policy for religious discussion in her class. I grew up in Utah, which for anyone that doesn’t know, is were The Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints (Mormons) has its headquarters. Utah was founded by Mormons and so naturally, there is a lot of Mormons in Salt Lake City, UT. This teacher would snap down on any sort of discussion that even remotely was religious. This would be story worthy, if not for the fact that she was a hard core catholic and would constantly go on about catholicism. I don’t have an issue with any religion, but the shear hypocrisy and disrespect this teacher had for other religions put a bad taste in my mouth even today. One day, I was sitting next to a girl in class she was humming what I thought was a nice tune, so I started humming the tune with her. I didn’t know it at the moment, but the tune was a Mormon hymn. The teacher walked pasts and heard us and identified the song. She immediately grabbed me and the girl and brought us into the hall without even telling us why. She bent down in front of us and pulled out her cross, shoving it in our faces and saying aggressively, “There is one church! There is one church!” I was not aware what was going on, but the girl started crying. She then processed to makes us say it with her. Me being completely in the dark just obeyed and said it with her. The girl did to, I’m guessing because an authority figure was aggressively ordering her to, she being six like me, just did it. She then let us go sit back down and that day went along. Remembering back as I got older, I realized that this teacher forced a six year old girl to denounce her own religion. I don’t know if the girl told her parents, but I transferred out of that school when my mom found out what had happened. Idk if the teacher was disciplined, but I hope she got fired and blacklisted.

Edit: six, not seven."
Head teacher's pet,"Relatively short story but does requires quite a bit of backstory.

So my school recently had a refurbishment which resulted in the majority of the school to be a long corridor on both floors. Due to congestion, the school introduced a one-way system (which actually made it worse) so if you had say R.E and then English, you would have to walk to the back of the school, down the stairs, back to the front of the school and up the stairs again. Now it is worth noting that the only teachers that follow this are the ones that try to suck up to the head.

Story:

I had English and one person (as always) was a few minutes late but he went against the one way system to get to class which the teacher across the hall noticed. As this person sat down, the teacher came into our class and actually made him leave and walk around the one-way system to ""get to class properly""

My teacher said to us when she left ""Why is she always free when I have you lot?""

Thank god I only have a year left."
But you’re a girrrrrrrl,"I was a book nerd in high school. Still am to be honest. I grew up out in the boonies, and we had three channels on our TV when the wind was blowing right. Therefore, I read. A lot.

Freshman year of high school I had signed up for College Prep English. Basically AP before it was called AP. Getting into those classes was unnecessarily difficult because my family was poor in an affluent school. That little episode is a story for another day, however.

My freshman English Teacher was a grade A 
Misogynist.  He generally ignored the girls in class, which I didn’t really mind because I was shy. He did, however, begin noticing the books I was bringing into class. I went through a phase where I only read books that were considered really difficult. Think, “War and Peace” and “The Fountainhead”. He’d scoff and say, “ You’re not really reading that. Stop trying to look smart.” It’s not exact, this was 20+ years ago.

Now, this pissed me off. I was reading those books! (Well, not War and Peace...that schiznit was boring!) I decided to just keep quiet and ace all his tests. 

He had this assignment where he assigned you a book, you read the book, and then you took a test on the book. Bear in mind this was a high level English class. He assigned me “The Red Badge of Courage.” First off, I’d already read it, and second, I hadn’t liked it. Plus it was tiny, and this was supposed to take two weeks of class. I didn’t really feel like spending a week and a half twiddling my thumbs in class. I started looking around at the other student’s books and noticed that all of the girls had similarly sized (small) books, while the boys all had 500-800 page books.  I internally rolled my eyes and went up to one of the boys in class.
Me—Hey, you wanna trade?
Boy—(looks at my book, then back to mine) Are you kidding? 
Me—Nope.
Boy—Of course, if it’s ok with Mr. E.
We walk up to Mr. E and present our case. He looks me up and down all smug and patronizing.  
Mr. E —Are you sure you can finish it in time?
Me—uh, ya.
Mr. E(looks unconvinced)—If you’re sure, but I won’t extend the due date.
Me—Sure.

I took the book home and finished over the weekend. I shouldn’t have. I was going to bored in class, but the book was good. (The Caine Mutiny) I went in on Monday and asked to take the test. 
Mr. E—You didn’t finish that book.
Me—Yes I did, can I take the test?
Mr. E— I won’t let you retake it.
Me—Okay.
Mr. E— This goes against my better judgement, but if you want to fail. (Hands me test)

Y’all, I got a 100. That test was thirty questions of multiple choice. If I had only skimmed the first few chapters I could have passed it. 

Later in the year he got pissed at me because I got a 100 on his “super hard” Romeo and Juliet test. He told the entire class that I had ruined the curve. I didn’t really care. The kids in that class thought I was beneath them anyway. 

So that’s my story. I know it doesn’t involve cursing or violence, but he’s one of the horrid teachers that made me actually become one.  :)"
Middle school choir,"Fucking middle school, where to start? Everything was bad there...I’ve put most of it behind me, but I doubt I’ll ever forget this. I had a teacher, we’ll call her Mrs.J, who I liked throughout 6th & 7th grade, she was strict but liked my art & I even called her Choir Mom at some point, she was kinda a bitter person but I really wanted positive attention & validation back then so I kept taking her class. Cut to 8th grade & there’s this kid we’ll call Wannabe Eboy or WE for short, he was one of those kids that started fights or clapped back at you for no exact reason other then he wanted to even though when you started fighting back he couldn’t back it up. I managed to stay outta trouble with Mrs.J until one day when I was playing around with one of my guy friends & he accidentally touched my chest, I’m really self conscious so this really bothered me even though I knew he didn’t have any ill will at all, so I backed off & stayed in the corner for a while. WE walks in & somehow finds out what happened, his response was “who cares, she’s flat anyway” 

Oh so we’re playing THAT game

I thought I could trust Mrs.J & told her what happened as I was very upset & wanted to deescalate the situation because my friends where about to fight him, instead of backing me up she called me into her office & grilled me for about 45 minutes about how it’s my responsibility to not care about what he said & how it’s completely up to me about my opinion of myself, basically, she couldn’t wrap her head around the concept of a teenage girl being hurt by someone insulting her looks & sent me away without getting him in trouble. I walked out crying & ready to cause a scene, if she wasn’t going to defend me I was gonna do it myself, I called him a dickhead & he ran to her office with his tail tucked between his legs. She then called me back & gave me a sermon about how just because he insulted me I had no right to insult him back & how he hadn’t done anything to me...ladies & gentlemen, hypocrisy is live & well. I spent the rest of the day crying & to this day I have troubles with crippling self consciousness problems, this woman later had the audacity to ask why I wasn’t calling her choir mom anymore. Fuck you too, Mrs.J"
Entitled Teacher tried to Fail The Students for her own negligence,
I might of failed my busniess junior cert,"Back story.: I'm in the Irish school system (it's kind of like high school). So we have a subject busniess studies and have started a new way of learning it and there is a new test and everything. My year would be the first to sit the new testing for it. Now on to the story! 
 
So I started off a new year of school with new classes I chose ect. I go into my busniess class and sit down beside my friends. My friend is a real chatter box and complainer everyone who knows her knows that. So she kept talking as the teacher was telling us about our junior cert. I told the girl beside me to shut up so the teacher moved me becouse she thought I was talking. 

Through out the year she would be mean to me critsizing my homework and projects and me in general. So as a part of the test for 10 percent you make a little paper with information about a subject. I was out sick the day it was  ment to be handed in. I had it becouse I have a printer and the other in my group didn't. The next day I came in with all the paper work and more and she complains that's its too big so I take out some surveys sheets. She then complains about that and comes storming after me down the hallway and screams at me saying how she is being nice letting me hand it in a day late (when there is a group of guys who don't even have it done) and how she is so nice that she didn't report me to the principal. I was about to cry becouse I was still sick from the day beforehand and was under alot of stress with other projects I hand to hand in also. I handed in everything and then went back to my art class and relaxed. I was lucky a few months later she went on maternity leave and we didn't have her for the rest of the year"
Math teacher messed up my life.,"I can’t remember if I have told you about this before but I had the worst teacher for year 9 to 11 now when I was in school, we were meant to start preparing for out math GCSE in year 9 you know learning all the things that were going to be in the exam and stuff (our so called teacher was the deputy head this important later). So, year 9 started we all filed in to the class room and this guy started to hand out the book and then that’s it goes through the book cover to cover no talking ok that’s not teaching.

You finished the book oh well go get the marking book and MARK your OWN work the only time we go our work marked for us was when we had tests (how are we meant to do tests if we are not being taught).

Homework do more of the book (never did that) I complained to the head teacher he did nothing I asked how to contact the governors I was not given the information for that.

So, year 11 rolled around and thanks to this man that didn’t’ teach us I Failed my GCSE math and left the school with the skills of a kid from year 8 so he messed me up.

A few year ago, I was surfing the net and I found in the end 2003 he was struck off it didn’t help me but at least he can’t fuck up anyone else now."
"I originally posted this in r/entitledpeople but then I found this sub so obviously, here you go!",
Oh my,
English Teacher Hated Me,"So I am from Europe and English is my second language. I started learning English on my own as a kid when listening to music and watching shows, and English is honestly not a difficult language compared to some others (+ you learn like the same six things every year in school).

In high school I had a different teacher every year, and they all had their own teaching methods. Not to sound like an ass, but I did know more than my classmates, and by 9th grade I was already fluent in English.

My 9th grade teacher understood I was bored in class, so he made me read more advanced books and write book reports instead of the homework assignments everyone else had. My 10th grade teacher let me study other subjects during class, but did require me to present the same homework as my classmates. I thought both teachers were very fair.

In 11th grade I got a really nice teacher that didn't require me to do homework or study, and she even provided me with a Cambridge textbook so I could prepare myself during the year to take the Proficiency Exam.

However, I got a different teacher in the 12th grade, the most important year where every single grade counts before university.

This woman hated me from the first day and I'm not exaggerating. She was the head of the English department, and I guess the other teachers I had over the years saw that I would be in her class and mentioned that I was a bit more advanced than the rest of the kids.

So on the first day of class I'm completely prepared to pay attention (I don't know this woman and I don't know if she will let me do what I want like the other teachers or not). I have a notebook out and I'm taking notes during class. She doesn't look at me once. She asks us to present ourselves one by one in English (typical stuff - name, age, a hobby). I get up, say my name and how old I am and she cuts me off and tells me to sit down. Everyone kinda just stares at her or at me and there's an awkward silence. I sit down and try to not turn red.

She comes up to me the next class and says ''You must be really bored in class, huh?'' and is being super sarcastic. I tell her that is not the case at all, and I have been paying attention. She ignores me and walks away.

During the rest of the year she purposefully gave me and another boy in the class lower grades. The difference between me and him was that she hated me from the first day, but started hating him after she found out he was also good in English. We were the two best people in class and got grades that were sometimes lower than the people that didn't know the basics. As she was head of the department, we couldn't really complain and had to keep our heads down.

I handed her my homework during the first few weeks of school, and she corrected a bunch of things that were not wrong at all. I asked her what the issues were, and she once again sarcastically replied ''I thought you knew English''. I refused to do homework after that, so she stuck to correcting my exams wrongly.

She also specifically corrected my friend who sat next to me whenever she felt I was giving him answers. He asked me simple things during class and she would tell him that they are wrong on purpose. For example, he asked me about numbers once. He wanted to know if saying twenty three hundred instead of two thousand and three hundred (2300) is correct. I told him yes. He then answered the teacher by saying a number that way, she looked at me, then said ''Who in the world told you that this exists?? This is so wrong!'' and then LAUGHED AT HIM in front of the entire class.

At the end of the year, we get our grades and I of course have a terrible grade (7/10). As she's handing me the papers, she has the nerve to say ''Such a shame you didn't cooperate during class.  I would have bumped your grade a bit if you had done your homework''.

I contemplated whether or not to go back to the school and hit her over the head with my C2 certificate but why would I even bother?

TLDR: English teacher hated all students that knew more English than her (she was terrible at her job and couldn't even speak properly)."
Music teacher forbids violas,"Freshman year I was second chair viola in the school orchestra. Sophomore year, the music teacher retires and a new music teacher posts the audition sign ups. I noticed there were no viola slots and went to him to ask about it. 
Me: Mr. H (obviously not real initial), where are the viola sign ups?
Mr.H: We aren’t doing violas this year.
Me (thinks this is a weird viola joke): Um, but who’s gonna fill the viola parts?
Mr. H: We’ll have a third violin section. Violas are too problematic.
I thought he was just joking and just awkwardly left. But no, he wasn’t joking. He didn’t allow a single viola into his class that year. He’s either a moron or someone that’ll do anything for a joke."
Math teacher keeps counting off random points,I’m in 11’th grade and my teacher keep counting stuff wrong or partially wrong even though they’re completely right and I show all the work and recently she gave me a 20/50 on a math xl assignment (online math) even though it clearly shows that I got 50/50 questions right and she got onto me for a really small issue I caused I’m working on emailing her to get credit for those questions. Thoughts?
Teacher threatens kid with expulsion for probably nothing.,"So in 5th grade there was a teacher, Mrs. C.    
  There were rumors spreading that she was calling my class a bunch of female dogs (worse language was supposedly used).  I didn't believe these rumors until one day...
      A classmate bought chips with his lunch.  A lunch lady came up to our table and told him that the chips weren't charged on his account; accusing him of theft.  So he says
that it was a mistake, appologises, and gives her his account info so he can pay.  For a few minutes we think that's the end of it. Then we see a fuming Mrs. C come over. She asks him ""What happened?""  As my classmate begins his response, Mrs. C shouts ""U STOLE IT!!!""  Every attempt to calmly speak is met with ""U STOLE IT!!!"" or expulsion threats.  Keep in mind, this is a $1.00 bag of off brand Lays, which were eventually payed for.  But it gets worse; after lunch,all we can talk about is the crazy lady's verbal rampage, so naturally she randomly bursts into our classroom,disrupting class, and threatens every one who committed the 'heinous crime' of speaking words about her with loss of recess, a tactic similar to dictators who would heavily censor newspapers or lock up those who disagreed."
PATCHOULI IS HELL,"When i was in a special needs class in middle school the substitute teacher would slather on patchouli lotion. we would turn into a pack of wolverines because the smell was unbearable! the teacher was nice but the smell would make every slight action unbearable. one day we saw her run empty on her lotion, we were going to celebrate only to find out she had 10 more bottles in her purse!!!!

When you're a special needs teacher you don't put on obnoxious colors or strong perfume because these are absolute pain for people with sensory issues!"
Teacher forbids me to eat,"Ok to get this out inglish is not my first langua 

Head acters: me: just some kid t: hellspawn teacher mf: my friend  


So we had a 3d printer at school and we made our own design to print it out it was almost reces and i was working on a design and i didnt know how to save it so i went out and ask my teacher not the other one this is the good one and i came back to save it and mf wanted to show his design so i looked at it ar the time everyone was out side at this point so t says go outside to late to outside and i think to myself this is the only reces for today i want to eat so i ignore her and grab my bag and go outside she kept saying to put it back and finnely the twig holding anger snapped she rushed at me and before i could step outside i was pulled back inside  dragged back and as the kid i was i started crying and then she was rambeling about a ten year old boy crying impossible then a few hours later i told i was hungry and said i didnt eat and my mom was like why i told the story and i heard that she put a kid in a closet as punishment and that was my story about a hell spawn teacher"

Teacher explodes twice (2 separate days,"Ima make this short for convenience
Grade: 7
Teacher: substitute
Story 1
Why she exploded: some kids being annoying plus mine and my friends tone
So me and my class were going into social studies which is in our class with a NEW AND DOWNGRADED TEACHER!
So me and my friends are sitting there talking and writing than I handed in my work and said here in my normal voice 
(In school it sounds like I don’t give 2 craps bout anything) 
And some people were just talking and not doing work also being annoying like usual, every teacher knew we had a tendency to do so
And she seemed very annoyed witch was unusual to say the least most teachers laugh our just tell us to be quiet or make jokes with us them but not this ant fun asshole she started yelling and saying that 
“I can’t believe your going  to grade 8”  and “I’m very disappointed” 
Before she could rant more the bell rang THANK CHRIST
Day after rant 1: after assembly witch we have daily (they’re sooo annoying) 
The principal and the Substitute came in and said we all had to write letters. Even me and my friends did for whatever reason so I wrote one saying I’m sorry for whatever reason i was I didn’t know, when I handed it to her she said
“It was for ,y tone and it was impolite ” first off if she ever heard me talking and if she did my voice sounds as if I’m always sarcastic and second off I find it kinda insulting that she would make me write a letter over my own voice
Now I have to ask my friends what else she said I’ll be back soon."
Sopmore Spanish teacher has favorites and attempts to embarrass/bully kids she doesn't like,"I had this Spanish teacher who over all was just a constant bully to the kids she didn't like for whatever reason. She singled out me and a couple other girls. I was always incredibly quiet and shy in the class, at the beginning of the year she had an attitude with me and set up situations to make me look stupid and say these little comments. At first I dismissed it but then I tried to tell my councilor of her actions many many times but he always happened to not be there :/ So then I'd forget and the cycle would continue. Eventually when I never gave her the reaction she wanted she started picking on these other two girls. While creating a pedestal and favor two other girls who she saw as smart and successful. While constantly putting the others down and making people intimidated to try. Especially people like me who are constantly processing alot of stuff already so they react slower then others do. I remember on the last day of how she randomly decided to just rip into me because I mentioned how I was trying to find a job because she asked me what I was doing over the summer, while the other girl she liked already had one. She made a comment along the lines that I was already too late and I wasn't going to get one at all, acting like I was just some waste case because at the time i dressed badly due to the financial issues my father and I dealt with. 

She was much better at insulting you without directly saying it flat out then she was ever at teaching Spanish. It was ridiculous because my Brazilian friend called her out on so many words she didn't know (she wasn't native to the language) and her accent was terrible. 
So dear mrs. A, enjoy your sad pitiful life of bullying teens you deem are worthless/stupid.
I know my worth, people like you will never make me believe I'm stupid because I don't fit your mold. I'm training to become an EMT, and I'm not just some junkie kid so screw you. 

Tldr; My petty spanish teacher picks favorites and puts down basically the rest of her class while choosing a couple of kids to harass throughout the year."
Choir director thinks I shouldn't report students who bring drugs to school,"So this is actually my first Reddit post, but I got hooked on Reddit readings on youtube, and I created an account just to tell this story. Feel free to correct me on things Reddity.

But some backstory: My school at this time had a ""tip line system"" which was just an area on the school site where you could leave reports of something you thought the principal needed to know. I think it was supposed to be anonymous unless the principal needed to talk to the poster. The school could track whatever you did on the Chromebooks they give out to students if they felt the need to.

I'm a big choir nut and I refuse to go to a school without the art. That year the choir teacher I had was definitely...weird. She was beloved by her students as choir directors generally are. She was just kind of an odd ball-even for a choir teacher. She was terrible at planning and really just bad at teaching. I didn't agree with her methods and she taught my class next to nothing. She just let all the girls interrupt her to have a class-wide gossip session. I spent most of my time next to some insufferable people who only wanted to talk and sneak time on their iPhones. They even disliked me and my friend for ""not trying' when in reality we were just not so good at the jacked-up way we had to sight-read due to being new kids to the district.

Anyway, this school was a lame Junior High so a lot of classes had ""A+ tutors"" who were just older high school students who got volunteer hours in by helping around some classes. We had 3, 2 girls and 1 boy. I don't have to censor names because I never bothered to learn them. The girls hung out with each other most of the class, and would often bring the Choir teacher (let's call her Mrs. C) Sonic from across the street. The third one, who's name I should know by now, literally listened to music 90% of the time on his phone or sometimes gossiped with the annoying girls in my section while they should have been practicing. 

One time he was doing just that. After chatting to the other tutors, joking about his cup which was NOT a see through bottle.  They were whispering back and forth, but the Alto section of the risers was close to where they sat. 

Girls: Wait. what is it?

Boy: \*whisper I couldn't catch\*

Girls: wait really? What flavor?

Boy: Green apple!

Girls: oooh. Yeah, I like wine better. I've tried it once at my mom's but I-\*notices the teacher and quiets down\*

Boy: Wine is shit. Do you want to try some?

I'm pretty sure they declined. This is definitely not the exact dialogue, its been quite a bit. Later this caught the attention of the annoying girls. The loud one interjected into their conversation. She asked what it is and he mouthed something I couldn't hear, but I was sure it was ""beer.""

They had a similar conversation I couldn't quite hear despite desperately trying. After the class got out It was time to go home. When I got home I was nervous. I knew I needed to report it, but I  wasn't sure how. Even though it was the beginning of the second semester, I didn't even need to talk to the principal or really even go to the secretaries. Then I remembered the ""tip line"". I heard kids joking about it, but I didn't really know what it was. I had, however, seen it on the school site.

I opened up my Chromebook and described what I thought happened. After that, I shut it back down and forgot about it. 

A few days later I got called to the office during gym. I was drenched in sweat and wearing old, oversized clothes. I also immediately shivered as I entered the air-conditioned office lol. As a certified good kid, I was extremely nervous when I talked to the principal. He showed me a picture and asked me if I recognized the kid. At first, I said no, but then I took a look again and realized it WAS him, he just changed his hair. It really sounded like I was lying. If I wasn't me, I would've *thought* I was lying.

Here's where the teacher comes in. (I know it's been a long post already lol)

No one noticed for a few weeks as the tutors seem to pick and choose when they actually show up to school. (I remember this part much more clearly)

Loud girl: When is ( Boy Tutor's Name) coming back?

Mrs.C: \*visibly annoyed, instantly\* Never

Loud girl, dramatically: What?! Why?! (while the other ones gasp)

Mrs.C, full of disgust and rage: someone *TIP LINED* him. 

The entire class goes quiet until another girl asks why.

Mrs.C: I Can't actually tell you that I'll get in trouble. But I *can* tell you it was someone in this room. I don't think they should've done it-he didn't deserve to get in trouble and lose his scholarship for something so stupid but-whatever It's not my place to discuss. What's done has been done.

The worse part is that this is the type of teacher to have obvious favorites and she showed her dislike for me from this day on.

Also, I ran into the tutor boy a few times when I went up to the high school to get algebra help lol. At one point he was complaining about going to the local college because he 'didn't have the scholarship with A+ anymore' or how he got his truck taken away 3 times since then for ""pissing off"" his parents.

Even though my own guardians at that time (not my real parents) also chastised me, I think I did the right thing. ~~Actually I know I did.~~"

7th Grade English Teacher From Hell,"I’ve tried my hardest to never be a problem student. I kept my grades up, I was really quiet in class, and I made sure to get homework in on time. 
For some reason though, my 7th grade English teacher, absolutely despised me. 
At the time I had crippling social anxiety that I had to tell the teachers about. It was bad to the point where I would get physically sick in front of bug crowds. This teacher however, who I’ll call Mrs. G, completely disregarded that. 
We had a presentation coming up and I was hoping that like all my other teachers, she’s let me do it in private at lunch. 
Every other teacher I had had no issue with this and understood that it was completely reasonable.
Mrs. G said it was a “waste of her time and completely unnecessary”. And so next class period I had to present in front of everyone, which resulted in multiple stutters and eventually I passed out. 
She brought the issue up at conferences, telling my mom I “put on a show” for the class and caused an “unnecessary” distraction. When my mom brought up the legit issue I had because of past and current bullying she told her that I “was making stories up for attention, and that my class had been nothing but nice to me”. I remember seeing how red and angry my mom got, but she dropped it and we moved on.
That year I also took my first year of Spanish, and I remember coming to class really excited about a test I had gotten a perfect score on. I was telling my friend and Mrs. G overheard, and called me out in front of the class. She called me a “self-centered narcissist” (Which I find funny because those literally mean the EXACT same thing). I was so embarrassed. I had to excuse myself to go throw up because everyone ended up looking at me and it was because she didn’t know it isn’t OK to call out students like that. 
I brought it up to the counselors and they dropped it, never giving me a reason why or anything. 
At the time I was also trying to figure out who I was in terms of sexuality since it had been bugging me a lot. I figured I was bi and one of my friends made me a bracelet with a rainbow on it. After a class she stopped me and asked about it, and I was so giddy I completely ignored everything she had done and announced proudly that it was indeed a pride bracelet. Her response? “You’re just a kid going through a phase, that (bisexuality) isn’t even a real thing”
I was really upset about that, and it made it a lot harder for me to come out again when I realized later that I was a lesbian. So she messed that up too. 
The last incident is what I remember best. 
At the end of the year she did a thing where she told each individual student what she thought about them. In front of everyone.
I was first, since I was the front corner.
She said I was “manipulative and demanding, but I draw anime good”. 
I don’t even draw anime, so I was just angry to myself and then I was gone when the bell rang. 
So yeah, worst teacher ever.
I’m only a Sophomore though, so someone worse may come along.

Teacher makes me cry and lies about it.,"English is my third language so I don't know if there will be any mistakes. I will let you know that I was a good student at all my classes like teachers favourite student. So this happened to me when I was at 6th grade in Syria and I had a geography class, my teacher finished teaching and went on her phone, (okay so we had this rule in school saying that nobody can use phones in  class and she was breaking it). So everyone was talking to each other and there were a boy who was teasing me so I was telling him to stop, and the next thing I heard was my teacher shouting at me saying:SHUT UP OP I HOPE YOU DIE. (She said it in Arabic just to me even though everybody was talking)everybody then went silent and looked at me, I started crying and she didn't even bother to say something to me. It was last class so everyone went home and I went home as well still crying and, told my mom so we got her number(because we were living in a small village everyone knew each other). My mom called her and the teacher LIED about it and said I was lying and she didn't do it , my mom told her that I don't lie(which is true) and then she said that she was tired and sick and taking medicine etc. My mom told her that it is not a reason. She didn't say it to me again but I don't love her as much as the other teachers."
You don’t have depression you’re just an attention seeker.,I used to have a teacher called mrs g who use to say that mental illness was a choice and didn’t believe I am clinically depressed (even had paperwork from my doctors) there use to be a kid in my class who would bully me constantly I use to tell my teacher but again she would say I’m an attention seeker and depression isn’t real one day he told me to kill myself in front of her and she said nothing I punched him and left the room she called my parents and told them this was completely random and she’d never been told about him bullying me they had a meeting my dad knew I was being bullied and knew what she had been saying to me. He went crazy at her and my parents pressed charges against the school she was promptly fired for negligence
"""Well, you were fine druing the warm-ups.""","(Note: I’m a 13 Y/O F with anxiety, depression, and asthma)

Okay, so, this happened last February. The September of 2018 I started taking music lessons from a dude named Mr. Mark.

To give you some perspective, Mr. Mark was a funny, non-judgemental hippie. He was sixty and he never made fun of my braces or quirks and when I was being bullied, he sympathized with me. He was just a cool dude and in the few months I knew him, we became close.

In late January, I was on a trip and I had to miss our lesson. When I came back, he wasn’t responding to my mom’s texts and we were getting worried. So, mom and I went to the building where we had our lessons and we were informed that he had passed away.

Now, before this, I had never been in mourning before so, I obviously took it pretty hard. On top of that, I couldn’t miss anymore school because I had already missed a bunch because of the flu.

The next day when I went to school, I let all of my teachers know what happened. Everyone except the gym teachers.

I was feeling like I’d been hit by a dump truck during our warm-up exercises but I kept it under control. Then, we went outside to run laps.

When I was hardly half-way through the first lap I felt horrid. It was freezing cold, I was in gym shorts, and I was depressed. I stopped to walk but the gym teachers started yelling at me to run. I was feeling a breakdown coming on but I tried to ignore it. Then, they called me over.

I was in tears at this point because of everything that was happening. I walked over to them and told them that I was in mourning. Their response?

“Well, you were fine during the warm-up exercises. Go inside, you’re getting a zero for the day.”

I was a mixture of livid and terrified. I was a straight-A student. If I got a zero, I’d have been screwed. I didn’t say anything and I just walked back to the gym.

I was near the door to the gym sobbing when the principal found me. I explained what happened and she tried to dry my tears. I was inconsolable at that point so, she just took me to the guidance counselor.

I was in the counselor's office bawling, telling her what had happened. She explained that I wouldn’t get a zero and calmed me down from one of the worst panic attacks I’d ever had. I then called my mom and explained what had happened. She was **furious** and offered to pick me up. I declined and said that I just needed to calm down.

I did and I made it to my next class late. I explained what had happened and everything was taken care of. Honestly, I can only thank my counselor and [Everlong by The Foo Fighters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBG7P-K-r1Y) for stopping me from going ape. It was the last song Mr. Mark tried to teach me before he passed. That song always calms me down now.

This story was sadly only the beginning of the war between me and my gym teachers, though. Stay tuned for more of my terrible tales!

Edit: Yes, I know I messed up the title. I'm so sorry!"
Placeholders,"So a little backstory. I was in 6th grade LFI, and our teacher went on maternity leave. We went through a few substitutes but there was just one that everybody hated, and he was gonna be our teacher for the rest of the year.

Now for the story. It was the last period and people weren’t really paying much attention. It was math, and i was sitting and whispering to my friends when he called on me to do a math question on the board. I was pretty good at math, so i did the question. He was not paying attention. Once i finished and let him know that i was done, he looked over my work and he looked irritated. After a few seconds he said “you did the place holder wrong, its supposed to be “X” not  “0”.  I told him “but its the same thing, i still got it right” and he said “No, you did not, you did the work wrong”. It went on  like that for a while until he yelled at me and i just broke. I told him flat out that he was wrong, and multiple kids took my side and he just gave everyone detention. We didnt get to go outside for lunch for a week, simply because he couldnt do grade 6 math. At the end of the year, his comment on my report card said “(name) has had trouble with math this term, specifically with multiplication and placeholders”


tl;dr: teacher cant do basic math and the class gets detention for a week"
Teacher asks if I'm saved when I'm sobbing,"This is might be a bit long and I might have a few details mixed up but the story still work. So, I go to a very Christian highschool and to make matters worse, I live in the bible belt. It was about three months into my freshman year when we were all brought on this retreat to...idk what the point was really. I have so many stories I could tell about that camp alone, but I'll keep it relevant to the title. It was the emd of the third day at around 10:30 and we were brought in for a sermon before bed, except this wasnt like the other sermons we had at the camp or even at school. One of my teachers starts off with a story of a man who found a dog and tried to kill it (I sware, I'm being serious) and when hes halfway through, I start to cry. But then he starts going into detail about jesus being captured and tortured on the cross. I'm not very emotionally stable at the best of times, but given the fact that I was already crying and was exhausted, you can understand that when I say I was sobbing. After 30 minutes or so of him going on and on about the gory details of jesus dieing, my bible teacher walks over and pulls me out of the room. The first thing she asks will stick with me forever. ""Are you saved?"" Not 'are you hurt', 'are you tired', or even 'are you ok'. This grown ass woman decides that asking if I beleive in jesus is more important then me crying BECAUSE MY TEACHER WAS TALKING ABOUT A MAN BEING TORTURED TO DEATH!! With what little credit she had left, and me still crying, she lets me get a candy bar and says she'll pray for me or whatever. I frankly dont want to remember."

r/Horrible Teachers,"**Background:**This all happened when I was in preschool{I'm currently in high school}. I have always been the kid to ask a lot of question in school, sometimes 3 times per class. Some teachers loved this while others hated this. I guess this teacher had enough of this.{Sorry if I can't remember all the details}

**Story**: This happened on a Friday at my preschool. I came into class and sat at my desk. I'm an introvert so I don't talk to anyone. The time is about 9:45 and I don't understand apart of our work so I ask the kid next to me if he/she could help me understand it. The teacher blows a fuse and yells at me saying that I'm not supposed to talk.{For some context this was a regular assignment not a test} Fast forward a little bit and now it's lunch time and the class is getting heads out for lunch the teacher holds me back in the classroom, while everyone else leaves. She turns off the lights, close the blinds, and puts duck-tape over my mouth and told me that I'm no supposed to make a sound or leave the room, and then she also leaves, now it's just me in the dark classroom with duck-tape over my mouth. About 25 minutes later she comes rips the duck-tape off my mouth and ask if I learned my lesson. I say ""Yes"" then she gets ready for the other students to come back. That night I tell my parents everything and they get furies the teacher ends up loosing her job but my parents decided not to press charges, but when I ask them about it they say they wish they did because apparently I could have died if I throw up the duck-tape on.

I don't believe this story is pro revenge but if it is please tell me and if you have stories like this this is a safe environment to share."
My Awful STEM Teacher,"A little background: my mom is a teacher at my school. Because of this, most of my teachers in high school already knew me. My mom and my STEM teacher had worked in the same hallway for years before my STEM teacher moved to a different classroom and started teaching a different class. I've heard it was because no one was taking his class, but that's just a rumor and I'm not 100% sure.

Also, STEM was a required class in 8th grade, and my STEM teacher (I'm going to call him Mr. 5 for reasons only my classmates will understand), was the only teacher. Everyone in my school had Mr. 5 in 8th grade.

So, I have a few stories about Mr. 5.

The first one happened on one of the first few days of school. As I'm leaving STEM, Mr. 5 comes up to me and asks, ""Hey, aren't you Shelly's kid?""

My mom's name is definitely not Shelly. Like I said earlier, he taught across the hallway from my mom for years. Not only that, but my mom taught THREE OF MR. 5's KIDS.

So, there was that, but that wasn't the worst of it. Another time, I was working at our school's blood drive during STEM. Now, the thing about blood drives at our school is that an email is sent to all the teachers about it, and even though all the workers are at school, teachers have to treat it more like an absence and give the workers a chance to do their work. You aren't allowed to leave the blood drive to go to one class if you signed up to work there, since it would be very inconvenient for setting up the blood drive.

I had STEM every other day in 8th grade. So, the day after the blood drive, I didn't have STEM. I came back the next day and Mr. 5 starts off by yelling at me for not having my homework even though I wasn't in class when we got the homework. I explained that I was at the blood drive and that I'd turn in the homework next class, but he didn't accept that. He starts yelling at me for not *stopping by his class and picking it up the previous day.* First of all, how was I supposed to know there was homework? I wasn't in class. I even told him this, and then he said that I should've checked. I didn't even know how to respond to that.

I'm not even joking when I say that my entire grade and the grade below us have stories about how bad of a teacher Mr. 5 was, and mine aren't even that bad compared to my friends'. It really says something that this guy has had a class for 2 years, and every student that took the class has storied about him being a bad teacher. 

One of friends told me a story about how she was sitting next to someone who fell asleep. Apparently, Mr. 5 tried telling her to kick the other girl. My friend obviously refused, but Mr. 5 kept trying to get her to kick this other kid. Eventually the kid woke up on her own (luckily).

There have also been plenty of stories about Mr. 5 making kids cry in his class. Like, a lot of stories."
The Awful Art Teacher,"Some backstory:
So basically at my school there is a teacher that nearly no one likes and thats the art teacher. Now, I like doing art, and I had to switch electives mid term to get into a certain class. My mom, who has this inane desire to have everything done right then and there, no matter what the circumstances, calls the school while we are getting some drinks at Human Bean to make sure they get my schedule changed. So I'm basically given 2 seconds to choose between art and computers, without any prior time to think. Knowing how many people hate the art teacher, I probably should have chosen computers. But I didn't want to get into the class of the computer teacher, who has an unbearably monotone voice. So I chose art. That was wrong of me. 
The Awful teacher part:
He is a harsh critique (this is at a middle school) and most people were lucky to get C's. Our passing periods are 4 minutes long, and he expects us to use the bathroom during those (walking from one side of the school to the other takes kids most of that time, but fortunately most of us don't have to walk that far). At one point I got a giant hydro flask (128oz, I'm pretty proud, lol). The teacher and his favorite student (who wasn't like the teacher, just really good at art and a little annoying) started calling me chug jug, though I told them not to repeatedly. I could understand the kid, but not the teacher, not when it bothered me and I told him to stop. But the best part was when I got a haircut that I really didn't like and was pretty self conscious about. I came to class early (my previous class was next door) and start talking to the favorite student (we were friendly despite his fortnite references) and the teacher comes over randomly and says ""{favorite student}, did you make a joke about her hair being lesbian?"" Then he walked away smugly like he just said the funniest thing in the world."
A group project i had to do for breast cancer😐,
Calc Teacher,"Here's is just one of many stories that I have about my high school Calculus II teacher:

So to start off, this was my senior year, and as many people know, senior year in high school can get fairly busy with college apps and big tests. To top it all off I was in the IB diploma program which, for those of you that don't know, is an extremely rigorous course of academics. 

Anyway, this teacher had a homework assignment due for the end of the week. This was one of many assignments I had to get done during through the week and since it was due on Friday, I pushed it farther back in my schedule. 

Come Thursday, we all get into class and our teacher announces that we have a homework quiz, which is where they ask you to copy down certain problems from the homework. 

I, along with many others in the class were confused as to why our teacher would give us a homework quiz the day before the homework itself was actually due. When we brought this up to him, he acted like it was the most preposterous thing that some people didn't have the homework ready on Thursday, even though it was due on Friday. 

This is one of many moments of incompetent teaching from this specific teacher."
Theater Teacher,"When I started middle school i didn't have a permanent theater teacher, because the real one was out because she was pregnant, but that later turned into a miss carriage, so she had to take more time off to deal with the psychological pain of not having her 2nd child. Than she came back, and was a really good teacher. But she had t leave after my 7th grade year, because her only child was having health problems that hospitalized her. So we got a new theater teacher which we're gonna call pig, because it kinda rhymes with her name, and she was somewhat fat. Right off the bat she didn't really like me, i don't know why, but she was like that with every class, at least 1 kid in every class was used as an example, and i guess i was one of them. She also did what a teacher ""should"" do and destroyed my dreams of being an actor.

First bad thing that year was our first show. It was a school play that the entire school could participate in, which i didn't normally do, but i did it 8th grade year because i was in advanced theater. We had to do Wizard of Oz and somehow i did good, because i made it as Uncle Henry, which i didn't mind till i found out i wasn't double casted. Which meant that i had to be in all 4 plays, which was 1 Thursday, 1 Friday, 2 Saturday, with no break. Lucky for me i had to memorize something for the next show, but we're no where close to finishing with this segment, sadly. I had problems with the kids, because the 7th graders were literally demons, so would do anything to see me get in trouble, which included framing me for no good reason, and since 6th graders are more related to 7th graders than 8th graders they followed along with the 7th graders, which got me in trouble with pig. She would use me as an example for the entire play, which was about 150ish kids, maybe more. She would yell at me for something, but if someone did the same exact thing as me, they wouldn't get yelled at. Then one day she threatened to kick me out of the show, A DAY BEFORE THE ACTUAL PLAY. She said she had people lined up for my pitiful role. That's word for word, i recorded everything she said to me on my phone, and yes i didn't have her permission, but she did it to me, she had a 6th grader sit right next to me backstage, so i sounded really loud, when really i was whispering, so i got in trouble with the co producer to, which was the music teacher, who was awesome. Anyways after the last show on Saturday i came down with a fever, and ended up catching the stomach flu. Unfortunate. Remember i had to memorize something for Monday, but couldn't because i was throwing up and sleeping.

Second bad thing. We had a UIL play which is very, very important, and try outs were the Monday after Wizard of Oz, but i was sick, and had 4 back to back shows i had to do, so no i didn't memorize it all. I memorized half of what i needed to, when i did the try out it was before school in front of the 1st period class and a couple advanced theater kids to make sure i was doing good, and pig was there. I should also mention the UIL is ADVANCED THEATER ONLY. Anyways after i did it i saw pig just giving an disapproval face. Than after that we had a callback, and i was still in, and i did a performance so good, the entire theater class clapped, which is hard to do when everyone in there is a pro. Then she said that the students would be voting, and based off that is how it would be casted. So we waited, and i asked everyone if they voted for me, and they all said yes. There's only 2 boy roles, but it was double casted, so there were 4 slots open for boys, and only 6 boys, one of which is always lights, because hes a tech guy, and that's what he ALWAYS does. So theres a high chance ill get a part. The day when the list comes up, i go down with my closest friend, and one of the other boys comes running up to me all excited saying he made it, i asked him if he saw my name and he said no. That's when i realized that i wasn't on the list, i ran down to see the list, and i was lighting with the other guy. Which absolutely destroyed me. That means she purposelessly didn't put me on, everyone i asked said yes, yes they put me as one of the characters. UIL plays are super important, so you need to put the best of the best up there. I cried in front of my closest friend, because i didn't make it, and i knew the kids in theater felt bad, because the next day when i walked in all sad i got a group hug from all of them, but i bet they all regret doing that now. I ended up letting them all down when i quit the show. I did 2 of the 4 shows, and quit for a couple good reasons. Every performance we did i cried, because i felt insanely left out, and i wasn't doing what i loved so what was the fucking point. The second reason being she changed the set which messed up all of my notes, and she made me do them all over again, than shit on them and said that they were ALL wrong, but the other lighting dude said they were right, but then had to side with the teacher, because yeah. Oh and everyone was AGAINST the set change, only 2 people wanted the set change, 2 out of about 30 or so kids. So i quit when she pushed my buttons the day of the 3rd show. My best friend was telling a story about her break up that i was interested in, and people kept interrupting, and right when it got to the juicy part pig told me to go set up, even though i was, and i said wait a minute, and she yelled at me no, then grinned her teeth and yelled go set up. So i looked at her, and calmly said, no, i quit. Yeah i know a little bit of an over reaction, but the things leading up were why. After that everyone hated me, because i left them hanging. And the teacher hated me more. The only good thing was that i was captain of the improv team, until...

One day a week or so before the talent show, she just randomly told me i was a host of it, and that i would know what i was doing a day before the talent show. Well the day before i go up there, and she tells me that im going to be doing fortnite dances in front of everyone, because i ""seem the type."" Her reasoning, because i have a YouTube channel with 5 or so fortnite videos. I said no because i care about my reputation at the school. I'm not that popular but i didn't want 8th graders making fun of me the rest of the year and have anymore problems than what i already have, and had, 7th grade wasn't to hot. But i ended up quieting, she got mad, and emailed my parents, that i rudely quit the talent show, when all i did was tell the truth, which was i don't like the role i received, and that i had a butt load of homework i had to do. Than i listed that i had 3 things in math, a very important thing to do in ela (English language arts) and 2 science papers. Oh we also had to do a warm up the day before so we knew exactly what we were doing, but like i listed, i was pretty busy that day. So she took away my captain role in the improv team. Which was really nothing, and i bet if she found out i didn't care she would have booted me off the team. But it turns out i wouldn't have been doing the talent show anyways because i came down with another fever, thank you poor immune system. But then she ruined improv for me...

On our last improv show 2 weeks before school got out. I don't remember the exact skit, but it ended up me grabbing a Styrofoam plate from the school cafe, and taking a bite out of it. But the plate was in the classroom. When i first did it i thought it was a plate for the end of the year party, but after the performance i figured out that it was a prop in a play. Still not a big deal, it was from the school cafe, which is right next to the theater room, literally the stage is in the cafe, and there's a door in the back of the of the state that connects to the theater room. A **week** after the performance when im in her class she calls me over to see her, and asks me about a s Styrofoam plate, and i have forgotten about it, because it wasn't a huge deal, so i said no. Than she said that during 3nd period they were ""freaking out"" because a prop was missing and they had their final dress rehearsal, so they had to do the final dress rehearsal without the Styrofoam plate. I just sat there confused, and she asked me if i had anything to say. I asked why she didn't get one, keep in mind im in 7th period. She said because the cafe wasn't open. the second i heard her say that i realized she was lying so she could make a big deal out of it. In 7th grade a year before she came, i got a day of in school suspension for a reason i don't wanna talk about, and the cafe opened during 3rd period to prepare for A lunch. But i didn't bring it up, and she asked me if i had anything else to say, and i said nope, and she told me she would email my parents about this, which gave me even more confusion. All i did was do something i didn't know was wrong, than ask her why she didn't get a Styrofoam plate from the cafe, which clearly shows her bias towards me, way more than the other reasons. After that class i went to science, where i studied for my finals, which are very, very, very important, way more important, than a Styrofoam plate may i add. But pig didn't think so. About 15 minutes after class started i was sent to her room where she gave me a this beauty.

Than when i got back to my science room, and sat down to do my final review, where i get called down to the VICE PRINCIPLES office, where i get scolded, and get 2 hours detention, so in total i got 2 and a half hours detention for literally nothing. But i very much appreciate what my parents did. My dad wrote an angry email back to pig, and cursed out the vice principle, which got rid of one hour, than my mom called the vice principle after, and i dont know what she said, but that reduced 30 minutes of it, so i got away from a lot.

Some things i missed that i don't wanna go back and put, or weren't that ""big"" of a deal, was that she yelled at me before i went to science to make the 6th graders laugh at me. She also cursed my dad out when i quit the UIL play. My dad had to pick me up, and he went in to talk to her, and she was really rude and stuff. She also yelled at me to walk home and that she never wanted me in the uil play. She claimed every voice recording i had was fake. Also in one of the 4 improv shows she scolded me for being ""inappropriate"". It was at an elementary school, and we performed for 5th graders, and dont remember the exact scene, but someone was trying to put their glasses on me, and i said it would make ME look like a nerd, iv'e had glasses on before and i looked really nerdy. Somehow it was offensive, because she saw the teachers shake their heads in discuss, when i saw them laughing, but she does have glasses so. But don't worry i got payback. We had a final project instead of a test, and i chose to do an alternate assignment of writing a play, so i could write a play about how my dreams crushed, and how she was a horrible teacher, and somehow i got an easy 100. Than on the last day of school i saw she blocked me on twitter, so i decided to go on my second account and roast her, and just be an awful person. The only sucky thing is, i have to see her 2 times a year in high school, unless i stop taking theater, or until i graduate. She is going to show the UIL play to every theater class, and she double cast, so i have to see 2 shows, thus seeing her twice a year, for 4 years. At least there's still a little bit of dream juice in me to continue."
my teacher tried to get me arrested just because she hates me,"so i will start by saying i have mild autism so im at a thing called a boces which.... i cant spell that.... but i digress.... all you need to know is i go to a school for disabled students....

now i know the title sounds very i wont take responsibility ish but hear me out....

i was.... ummm.... rough.... during my childhood and got arrested and sent to a boys home.... i spent a year and a half there and left.... 

so eventually i go back to school and everything is different exept for my math/homeroom teacher who i'll call sarah.... basically i go to school and had no written schedual yet so was kinda trying to figue out my classes as i went to them and got fed up with it....
so i go to my principles office and poke my head in.... he wasnt there.... so i go back to class and next period go again and he is there so i get everything resolved.... (this will be important) 

when i went home that day i thought everything was fine.... but then sarah calls my grandmother and says there is a cop with her and the cop gets on the phone and says....
 
hey your kid stole a phone from the principle of his school and the cops would be at my house in 10 minutes....

 so my grandmother askes me if i did it and i said no.... 
so we decide fuck it we will wait for the cops.... 
10 minutes pass by and no cop.... 
20 minutes no cop....
so the cop never shows up.... i go to school the next day and some random girl with a briefcase pulls me aside and says hey.... dont worry your not in trouble.... we found out another kid took the phone and is being charged.... i got pissed (obviously) and ask.... WHY DID SHE ASSUME IT WAS ME SO QUICKLY!!!!.... YOU GAVE MY GRANDMOTHER A PANIC ATTACK!!!!
she said...
well you have a track record of breaking the rules so you were most likely to do it....
i said.... SO A YEAR OF BEING AWAY AT A BOYS HOME ISNT ENOUGH TO CHANGE.... IM NOT THE SAME....
she says well the teachers dont know that but i ignore it and go to class....
 slamming my classroom door.... 
my science teacher who is fucking awsome listens to the whole thing and agreed with me and complained to the princaple for me on how it was handled....
 i text my grandmother and that was it.... 
if your expecting a happier ending there really isnt one....
 she still works there and everything.... 
but this pissed me off to this day.....

sorry if i misepelled anything or if its poorly written.... im bad at typing and punctuation so this may look very rushed...."
Sent to the office for LAUGHING,"Bt-bad teacher
M-me
F-freind
So mu class was doing this thing about debates, and my bt decided to let us pick the topic.  We all just joking around, and f said we should do should there be another avengers movie
Our teacher wasn't happy with all of the joking around on the topic of the discussion, so she called m, f and to girls out into the hall.
Bt: i am very disappointed in you timmy (not my real name) avengers is not a good topic for debated, and g1, come on why is icecream cold? ( ues, g1 actually suggested that for a debated topic) 
M and f started cracking up at this, point cuz she just said why is icecream cold right out of the blue, and it was hilarious at the time.
Bt GO TO THE OFFICE
me and f left"
A sub teacher I had was a bit to touchy,"One day in my art lesson (when we where 11 to 12) we had a sub teacher he was about 60 we go into the lesson and about midway through the lesson he walked around a table with a bunch of girls on and touched their buts, we were all shocked by this behaviour and one of the girls mum's complained about it. Sadly this isn't were it all ended. Not long after that we has him again in an art lesson we were all shocked by this and made sure we were all nearly sat together, that lesson this teacher would touch girls hands and backs, yes this could be seen as friendly but it just wasn't (just so you know when he walked when near the table you sat dead still and held your breathe out of pure fear), at one point in the lesson he turned around to a boy in our class and goes 'If you don't shut up I will poke your eyes out.'That was it, we had had it at that stage, so after a horrible one hour we went down to the office and complained. This was taken to the board of the school now to our council they made us wrote put a statment. Not long ago I was called in and had to add more detail to it, so my guess is the council may be taking it further, I will share if anything happens."
My 4th grade teacher announces to the whole class that I had a rash,"I know this story doesn’t have much to do with my teacher’s teaching skills, but I want to share it. ( Yet I do feel it is in the more inappropriate section of teaching..) So first I would like to start of by saying that I did not have a rash but actually eczema, yet I didn’t know how to pronounce it and instead I would usually say asthma( which is not even close to being the same thing as eczema).So one day I was sitting in class itching my legs like crazy due to my eczema; and my teacher who we will call Mr. King noticed this and then decided to ask very loudly why I was itching. I told him I had a rash (not really specifying what it was) and he made me get up in front of the class and wash my hands in front of the whole class so I wouldn’t “spread it” to other students. I know this story isn’t that bad but it resulted in kids bullying me due to the incident, and this is not the only story he has also done other things to me; which I will share in another story. So thanks for reading and have a great day, lovely people of reddit!"
Teacher Falls Asleep in Class,"I had Mrs P when I was in 2nd grade. This did not happen in my class but my dad told me about how weird Mrs P would be.

Mrs P was an older woman compared to the rest of the teachers (important) and had a mix of different medications that she took every day. One day she just fell asleep at her desk during a quiet activity. It was either during a test or reading time. Maybe her body did not react well to the meds or she did not take them. Who knows. I haven’t asked whether or not she got into trouble or the other details that day. 

When I saw her in the hallway during the 5th grade, I said hi and she acted like she had never seen me in her life. 

Since then, I have wondered what medication she was on and if she had a condition or if it was her fault that she fell asleep or the meds."
Teacher told me I shouldn't draw anymore in Middle School.,"I'm off to college now, but this experience still bothers me.

I just started Middle School at 6th Grade, and had a rough day.  But Iwas done with my schoolwork, so I decided to draw (I did that when I was bored). But then my teacher came and told me I'm not in Elementary School anymore and gave me class detention.

Because of this, I abandoned drawing and became jealous of any artist.

After 3 years I at least got back, but it still affects my confidence and self-esteem.

I just want to hear opinions on this matter."
-500 ego,"So basically these are the reasons I suck at fitting in.

1. So not that long ago, some student called me a freak and I told my eng teacher and she didn't care. Like, not one f**ing bit. And then later after class, I was goofing off with my friend saying ""merry christler"" and my teacher looked at me, smirked, and said, ""see, people don't like you because you say these things.""
Ouch.

2. OK, this one was the worst teacher situation in my entire life, so, my kindergarten teacher really hated me and got p*ssed off at everything I do, even if I wasn't doing anything wrong or I did good on a test or something.
I was even the only one who spelled ""like"" right with an e. Anyways, she hated my guts. Basically, as a kid, I had bladder problems as kind of a side effect from my appendicitis, So, I would constantly have accidents. One day, I had an accident in class, and she so-called 'kindly' explained, smirking, to whisper it to her next time it happened so I could go get new clothes. The next day that I had an accident, I whispered it to her, and that a**hole announced it to the entire class. because of her, I now have trust issues. So, as you would expect, everyone in the entire class was laughing and teasing and as my 5 year old self, I cried. She was laughing a little too, and she got kind of scared because of how loud everyone was and she shushed them and I was bullied for years because of an accident.
after that, I was never popular, and even some of my close friends left me after that.

F*CK YOU MRS. BOEM ಥ_ಥ"
I had a teacher that when I gave my friend a fist bump I went to the principle office.,"I fist bumped my friend and got sent to the principles office. Once I got back to the class I got sent to the hallway. She came out and started yelling at me. I asked what I did and she didint answer. I asked again and she litteraly pushed me on the ground. My head hit the ground and started bleeding really really bad. I asked if I could go to the nurse but she said ""If you go I'll hurt you way worse."" So snuck down there called my mom and told her. After that the nurse called 911 and I got taken to the hospital. My mom sued her for $100,000 and we won"
My teacher made fun of me for being disabled and is now in a wheelchair!,"I apologize for making this so long.
So in first through second grade I had this teacher who we will call Ms.Cook and at the time I was a tall pudgy kid who could not write, speak or read properly I had severe dyslexia (still do) and this got to her because I always got bullied by her and other students, she would constantly yell at me for not saying or writing anything properly and would sometimes throw the book I was trying to read and say books are for kids that aren't stupid! She would even make me read and write I'LL NEVER PASS HIGHSCHOOL on the board to the whole class when I said something wrong and she had this stupid nickname for me that always pissed me off which was little piggy . . . I HATED HER 

Fast forward to my sophomore year in highschool (my grammar is a lot better now though I still have problems), I was walking downtown with some of my friends from this book store that had a lot of stairs, when we got down to the end I heard a familiar voice coming from behind us and wouldn't you know it, it's   Ms.Cook still calling me little piggy as she walks down the stairs. Ironically breaking a heel on one of the steps and breaking her back in the process I stood there trying my best not laugh and just walked away with out saying a word or even helping her I did however call 911 and told them what happened. I then found out that she was arrested for stealing and drugs which just adds the cherry on top.




P.s I can't tell if this counts as a bad teacher story or a  revenge story."
my 8th grade math teacher bullies me,"So i'm just gonna say im terrible with words soooo bare with me. and i'm just gonna say i'm on mobile. i also not very good at giving details. 

&#x200B;

So about me i'm terribly in social situations like oh i don't know how to do something in class and i get yelled at or get a lunch detention just because i would break down and cry over every little thing. but one day i did the exact same thing and she's like hmm he's not responding to me he's not doing his work he's not doing anything but i think PULLING THE CHAIR OUT FROM UNDER HIM so i fell on the ground and freak out i just kinda gave up on life for a bit they evacuated the whole class and almost called a ambulance so yea i just got sent home the whole day. 

&#x200B;

That's the whole story sorry for spelling mistakes im kinda bad at this.

&#x200B;

this is my most suffier case of a bad teacher."
My bad Makerspace Teacher (Part 2),"Continuation of [part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/badteachers/comments/cb0wnk/my_bad_makerspace_teacher_part_one/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

So second semester I had Makerspace 2 as one of my classes. So first quarter of second semester when smoothly. Then second quarter happened. K and I started to work on the robot during our Makerspace class and we got really far on the build. Then we had it built on the last day of the quarter. It was fully functional we had video of it. We put the video on google classroom and turned it in. He still gave us a zero because we “didn’t turn it in by the deadline on (enter due date he never gave us)” So we both went to our guidance counselors with this and find out he has been doing this all year to students. He never changed the grade.

In my Makerspace 2 class there was a kid who was mentally disabled. He had a hard time reading environments and understanding sarcasm. There was this other group of kids that would pick on him and blame him for things he didn’t do. So this kid goes to Mr. A to get help dealing with these kids. And Mr A responded like this; “Deal with it yourself you’re in highschool”

Eventually this situation escalated to the point where these kids locked the mentally disabled kid up in the loft with another kid and said they wouldn’t let him down/out until he fought one of the kids. While this happened I pull out my phone start recording go over to mr A who is laughing ask him why he isn’t helping the kid, and then when he doesn’t respond I go over to let the kid out but then the MD kid kicked another kid so they would let him out before I got over there. Guess who got in trouble though. 

That’s right the MD kid. 

We started working on making the Panasonic CDC robot better for the finals including redesigning a couple parts to reduce friction, interchanging the side beams, etc. 

I was also in my Schools chapter of Technology Student Association (TSA). I was in the video game design team. Now my group didn’t finish the video game mostly cuz we weren’t ever able to meet up after school because someone always had something. So we all still had to go to the conference. So we got there and even though I had told Mr. A that My dad was going to have to drive me he was still mad that I wasn’t on the bus ride to the conference (This was on the weekend the only time I really get to see my dad during the school year) We got to the conference checked in and then went to breakfast. At breakfast Mr A tells almost everyone that he has signed them up for a second event and had never told any of us before that point. Me and one of my friends had been signed up for technological debate. Now i love debates when I have time to plan for them but he gave us no time to prep and told us ten minutes after we were supposed to be there. He then got pissed at us for not making it on time.

I’ll finish this story in part 3 sorry for the cliff hangers!"
My bad Makerspace teacher (part one),"So last year in my freshman year of highschool, I had an amazing Makerspace teacher. He made it so that I wanted to be in the Makerspace for literally half my life. I would stay after school every day until 5 or 6 o’clock. 

At the end of year I found out that he was moving to Costa Rica.  So last year we got a new makerspace teacher.  At the beginning of the year I was really eager to meet the new makerspace teacher.  Then I met him... and he was just the worst. So first off he is one of those really short guys who feels they have to prove that they are better than you if you are taller.  I’m 6 foot and he is 5’8” so you can see how that turned out. Next he also always told you that you were wrong. He also hated it when you came to him with ideas. 

So onto an actual story. So I am on the robotics team at my school. We do a competition known as the Panasonic CDC. This year the challenge was to build a robot that could do heart surgery. So in late September the team leader (K) had chosen me and another girl (T) . Everyday from October through mid December we asked if we could stay after.  This was his response everyday “sorry not today guys, definitely tomorrow”

Eventually,we start texting about it and I start to model the robot. We had come up with an idea for a robotic arm. Now I started to ask him if we could start cutting parts for it. I showed him the model and of course he told me it would never work. So btw I have anxiety and so does K, but I also have an unbreakable trust for my teachers. So I restarted and designed it from scratch.  Again he started with the whole “I can’t do it today bullshit”

Time jump to 3 days before prelims. 

3 days until prelims

We still didn’t have a physical robot built because he refused to let me use the laser cutters by myself and won’t cut the parts out himself. He suggests that we go with a Cartesian plane instead again and we reluctantly agree. We start building the frame. I draw up the models for the carriages. 

2 days remaining 

We had finals this day and the next day as my school works on a semester system. I didn’t have any finals the second day. So I went to the makerspace after my finals that day. We worked till 1 and got a bunch of stuff done. 

1 day remaining

The next day we came in at 7 o’clock and started to work.  We worked solidly until 11 pm we still didn’t have a complete robot.

Day of prelims

It was literally 0* Fahrenheit.  We started carrying everything out to the van. And then he locked K and I outside. He is standing right by the door. We practically punching the door. Eventually he let us in. We get to the competition and he decides that he needs to lubricate the threaded rod and nuts so he does that.  Then he decides to put **lubricant with a god damn plastic de-solvent on *LEGO* gears**

Then he blamed it on me when the gear shattered. 

Any way that is part one of my teacher problems I’ll post more later."
She put me in therapy.,"Hi! I am very new to Reddit so please be kind. 
                
Background: ( this is important!) I was in the 5th grade when this happened to me. So most of this was filled in by my mother. ( She was very involved in this keep her in mind. Also, I am very slow at learning, it takes me a long time to get a math equation right. (That is important). This was also taking place towards the end of the year.

Cast:
BT: bad teacher
P: principal
SE: special education teacher
M: me
MM: my mom

Let's begin!

BT was a teacher at my school who was use to teaching kids who learned things a lot faster than most. When she came across me and that i wasn't learning things as quickly as the others, instead of helping me ( like a teacher) she ignored me. I constantly asked questions but was met with her belittling me for not getting it right. Example:

BT: how could you not get that right? It's simple!

Slowly after time went on I started to get really anxious. About asking for help. I thought that she would belittle me again. So I stopped asking questions. After a few days it started getting worse. Her attitude to me got nasty. Example:

BT: Its not that hard (my name). Get it right. 

She would often say it with vemon in her voice. My mother through out this time was going through meeting after meeting to find help for me.  She eventually got me with the SE. But that didn't last long. She ended up ignoring me to. Often not helping me not because she didn't want to, but because BT had brought me down so much that I didn't ask for help. She had helped me a little but not enough to make me stay with her. So I ended back up with BT. One day BT brought in the librarian to help me do math because she didn't want to help me.

 One day the school anounced that they were going to have a talent show since the year was coming to a close. I have been playing piano for a few years at that point and really want to play. MM was happy that I was excited about something at school. ( Honestly me and my mom forgot what lead up to this part but keep in mind you have to fill out papers to enter the talent show). I went to school and asked BT about the talent show. She told me that I wasn't allowed to enter . I went home crying. It couldn't have been for the lack of a piano because my sister was performing on the piano to. And she had gotten into the show just fine.

MM sent an email to BT asking why I couldn't enter. BT called me to her desk dying reccess. I honestly don't wanna talk about this part because its hard to talk about even type. Let's just say, it wasn't nice. MM was pissed. She dragging BT, SE, P into a meeting. It went like this. 

MM: how come all together you have 14 years of education 4 dedicated to helping my daughter and all you came give me are ums and I don't knows?!

MM then slammed her hands on the table and walked out of the meetings. After that my mom got me into a session with a therapist but because I was so little I couldn't explain what I was feeling. ( Anxiety, depression, social anxiety etc) after that my mom home schooled me for the rest of the semester. I never got to attend that talent show. I'm now 15 and have really bad anxiety due to those times. But I'm doing much better! My mom is my hero. And I'm in high school and I trust teacher much more now.

Edit. There are spelling mistakes I'm sorry. 😓"
My Rude Home EC Teacher,"Hi again! I have another Bad Teacher Story.

Interestingly enough I didn't have too many problems with this teacher directly to me. She generally liked me. But these are a few things she did to other students that really pissed me off.

I'm calling this teacher, Ms. Salty because she was salty and refused to let us use salt in our food.

The first and biggest thing she would do is bully and belittle this one boy in my class.

This boy was from Brazil and he didn't speak much English. He was quite shy but would try to do as much as he could. But everytime he would ask a question, get something wrong or EVEN SPEAK, Ms. Salty would say things like ""You've been here for so long! Time to learn English, Little Brazilian Boy."" Or ""If you can't get this right, go back to Brazil!!"" 

She never called him by his name. Always ""Little Brazilian Boy"" I had enough and brought it up with a guidance teacher. But when I went into class, the boy had already dropped the class. I really couldn't blame him.

She also did a very similar thing to a group of students in my class with autism. She would refuse to help them and yell at them if they got something wrong. She also would threaten to take away the EA Teacher that was there to help them. I would usually go over to ask if they needed help.

Ms. Salty also hated salt. She told the whole class that we would not be allowed to use ANY salt in our food because, ""Teenagers eat McDonald's everyday and you all have enough salt in your diets!"" Maybe it was a nice thought but then she would ask everyone what they are having for lunch ((which took place after her class)) and if you were having something that had even a speck of salt or sugar in it she would belittle you in front of everyone.

She was also one of those teachers who insist that no matter what they are right even if they make no sense! For example. We were making spaghetti and meat sauce in class. I poured out the jar of sauce into the meat then put a little water into the jar, closed the lid and shook it to get off the sauce on the sides then poured that into the pan.

I did it all the time at home. Ms. Salty saw me do this and flipped out!!

MS: Ms. Salty
Me: Me

MS: WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?!?

Me: What? I do that at home all the time. That way I don't waste the sauce in the jar.

MS: BUT THE INSIDE OF THAT JAR IS CONTAMINATED!!

Me: But the sauce was in the jar. How could the inside of the jar be contaminated?

MS: YOU ARE ALL GOING TO GET SICK!! LUCKILY IM OLD AND DONT GET SICK!

Me: *gives up* Right. Okay.

She went on and on about how I was going to get sick from the jar and how she won't because she's old so she immune to more sicknesses than I am. I mostly ignored her.

More often then none though, Ms. Salty would refuse to help anyone in the class if they asked. Everyone would come to me for help because I had the most cooking knowledge. Everyone started calling me ""Chef"" in class because I knew the most.

Little did they know I learned everything from watching Food Network!

So that was my Rude Home EC Teacher! Thanks for reading!!"
Bad Math Teacher,"This might be really long but bear with me
I got a math teacher in 7th grade who really sucked. Let’s call he Miss C.
Miss C sucked. Everyone hated her. Even our just as bad Spanish teacher. She didn’t grade our hw or tests. She had her mommy come in and grade them during our class. And the hw was a completion grade out of 5. If you didn’t show your work, 2/5. No name, 2/5. 
One day, she was showing a problem on the board and she said 2-1=2. My class, being the good students we are, just sat there silently and waited for her to finish to correct her. A girl in my class (who is a bit of a show off) politely raised her hand and told her that we got a different answer and that she had said 2-1=2 when it actually should’ve been 2-1=1 to get the correct answer. No big deal right? Nope. The class ended and the teacher made the girl stay behind to talk to her. The girl came back in the middle of our next period and said that our teacher had taken off a behavior point for disrespecting her and embarrassing her in front of the class. Yeah, she’s crazy. Really wish she wasn’t coming back next year, but she recently got engaged and she needs to pay for her wedding lmao. At least it’s my last year with her"
This teacher is the devil,"So I know it's the summer but it's the perfect time to talk about teachers behind there backs.
So this teacher hated me and most of my friends in our class we had our own little group.
This is what happened in one day!!!p.s the teachers name is sra.canelo

Sra.c:ok class down your voice(shes from Venezuela so her English is terrible)

J:someone needs to teach her some English 

Me:yeah I can bar-

Sra.c:SHUT UP U DUMP ALL YOU DO IS-

Mrs.B:what's all this yelling about(she our English teacher btw were in immersion)

Then they have a huge argument and then we find out she was sent back to Gilbert (we live in sc) hope those middle school kids prank her every day"
A terrible experience with an elective teacher,"So, with this story it’s hard to explain everything that happened with this teacher but i’ll talk about the main situations that happened. So i was in an elective this year that was more of the higher class elective that was harder to get into. As i was in the elective the year prior i had automatically filled a spot on the roster. This elective teacher was always known for being crude and very serious on most days. I never really had a problem with this my first year because she automatically took a liking to me and i was known for being her “favorite”. During my second year in this class a situation had happened with me and four other students in the class. It was a big situation that got us all in trouble with this teacher, although it was mostly me who basically got the heat from the teacher. The entire year became hell for me cause whenever i would talk to her she would give me problems. Also a funny thing that happened is another student in a different elective class was saying things to my friends in that elective class to make me look bad (which really didn’t bug me). i told someone i though could be trusted and I shouldn’t have. They told the teacher and she dealt with the other student but then reprimanded me and my friend who told me about this issue. Obviously this made my opinion on this teacher very low and it led to me trying to leave the class but wasn’t able to due to some rule saying I couldn’t. So time had passed and the hatred she had for me started to dial down but i would still get yelled at daily. The last situation that had happened with another teacher (entirely my fault) led to me having to go to my elective teachers class in the morning and getting yelled at. I had already had a very stressful time apologizing and making it up to the teacher involved with the situation that i finally broke and had a huge panic attack in front of my friends and teacher behind them who took me to a teacher that i was very friendly with. This teacher and other teachers started talking outside while they waited for the bell to ring. After school started the teacher i was taking to took me to the counselor where the counselor and the teacher were able to talk to me before sending me back to my first period. This would lead to later on me and another student getting yelled at by my elective teacher. She sent the other student out and then yelled at me more for having a panic attack she said i blamed on her (I didn’t) and she started saying it’s school we dont have room for your dramatic self and your “panic attacks” (yes she did air quotes) and so from that day on i just stopped giving a flying fuck about my elective class and was just waiting for the school year to end. Now it’s summer and im going to the next grade which my ex-elective teacher teaches for. TL:DR I think i need to stop being stupid and move schools"
My terrible Gym Teacher,"Hey guys! I've got another bad teacher to tell you about.

Now this guy we are going to call ""Mr. F"" for Mr. Favoritism.

Now in middle school I was overweight, shy and very very self conscious. I definitely struggled in gym.

My brother who is older than me is the exact opposite. He is super fit, athletic and super confident. He did triathlons and even beat the beep test record in our middle school. All the gym teachers loved him.

Now Mr. F was one of those teachers who just loved my brother. For some reason this meant that I must also be as athletic as my brother.

So every single day he would talk down to me in front of the whole class, repeatedly saying ""Your brother can do so much better"" and just all around pressuring me.

Both I and my parents explained to him that I was not my brother and that him doing this was in fact not encouraging me. He didn't listen.

A few months later I unfortunately sprained my ankle. I was walking with my cousin and stepped into a pothole. I came to school with a doctor's note to give to Mr. F.

He read the note looked me straight in the eyes and TORE UP THE NOTE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. He then said ""Suck it up, Buttercup! Start running laps""

I refused. I told him that I had sprained my ankle and that I wasn't supposed to be running on it. He told me that if I wanted to fake an injury that I could go sit in the hall. I did. He called my parents who weren't happy with him.

He would yell at me everyday for 2 weeks while my ankle healed. Every single day he would say that it should be healed by now and how I was clearly faking.

After I left middle school and went to the high school nearby Mr. F, unfortunately was transferred there as well.

I still struggled in gym class. Especially when running laps. One class Mr. F made one of my friends PUSH ME DOWN AND AROUND THE GYM because I wasn't running fast enough for him.

Then my brother decided to transfer to my school. Before he did transfer though Mr. F said to me during a beep test ""I can't wait for your brother to come to this school. Somebody in your family at least does something well.""

Then there was the final straw for me.

Mr. F had taken us outside to play ""Ultimate"" which I wasn't 100% aware of how to play but when I asked Mr. F he ignored me.

So I just started playing. But nobody was passing me the ball because they knew I couldn't catch or throw. Suddenly Mr. F yells out. ""NOBODY SCORES ANY POINTS UNTIL OP TOUCHES THE BALL"" I was so embarrassed. Everyone was staring at me. I walked over to the ball touched it then walked off the field. I told Mr. F that I touched the ball but I wasn't going to play.

After class my friends from the other gym class who were across the field asked me why Mr. F had yelled my name. I told them and they chewed out Mr. F saying how that was so embarrassing for me. 

Mr. F took me aside and told me that there were people in the class who did nothing and were getting better marks then me. I told him that there was something wrong with his grading system then because there is no way that someone who actually tries their best should be failing when other people who don't do anything are passing. He said that his grading system was perfect and that it was me who needed to be like my brother.

I dropped that class the next day and did 2 summers of voulteer work to make up the credits. Mr. F always gave me the stink eye when I saw him in the hallway.

And that's my awful Middle school/high school gym teacher. Let me know if you want to know about my elementary gym teacher. Bye~!"
Teacher's behavior made me hate school.,"This was decades ago, so not exact wording.  

First posting, soz for any format etc issues. Kept it under 1k words.

(I was tested 3 years ahead of my age.)

After 6th grade 'graduation' to 7th, we all were given assignments over the summer.  Read 3 books, of your choice, and be prepared to write a 3 page report on one of them, and a brief summary of the other 2.  To give the teacher an idea about you, choice of books etc.  No worries, loved to read.  

&#x200B;

The assignment was for this teacher, refer to as Ms. C. I was in her class, but to be taken out 3x a week for advance classes.  I was required to do all her classroom assignments, but in adding I would be doing high school credit work.  She gave me attitude, saying that **I had better keep up,not let it go to my head that I was special.**  I informed her that ***I was looking forward to the challenge***.  She told me **not to be fresh with her**.  I just looked at her like wtf?

&#x200B;

She sat me up in front, directly in front of her desk.  Did not think much about it. She was going over the curriculum for the first quarter, and I am writing it all in my notebook, like a good little nerd.  She stood over me. When taking notes, I was the only one going to read it, so yeah, hooked on phonics, when I turned anything in I used a dictionary to check spelling.  She pointed to misspelled words, and tsk'd at me

&#x200B;

She then said she wanted us to write our 3 page report on our favorite book we read over the summer, and a few groaned as they had written one already. *(the assignment was to read, and be prepared to write report)*  So the couple that had actually done the paper, she let slide.  They were the pets you could tell straight away.  *(siblings were mentioned at roll call)* 

She stood right over me, and said, **I hope you have all read age appropriate books for this assignment.**  Leaned over to me, and said ***\~*** **I don't mean Green Eggs and Ham either\~**  I looked at her, and just said***. OH good, I'm more of a \~Hop on Pop girl anyway\~*** She growled at me to go to the principal's office, as she was writing up my first referral. 

 As I was waiting for him to see me, I wrote my paper.  Mr. M, asks me what happened, and I told him.  As Ms C only wrote I was rude and disrespectful to her in class. I told him, he smirked. *(tried to hide it)* told me to ***go back to class, and try to contain my comments***.  I remember looking at him, just like, wtf?

&#x200B;

Get back to class, give my signed referral back to her.  Turn in my paper. I had been gone about an hour. She told me I was ***going to be marked down, as my paper was late.*** I smiled, said, something \~***like as expected ma'am***.\~  She hit her desk said she is  ***not ma'am, she is Ms C***, and wrote me another referral. Back to see Mr. M., had to wait in the office again for about 20 minutes. He saw the referral, and told me I should probably just stay out of her way the rest of the class. First day of school, and I have my curriculum.  Fine, sat and read the books from class that were assigned.

Next day, went into class, she re assigned me to the back of the room. YAY so I thought. 

After attendance is called.  She is handing back papers, telling everyone that they **all did an okay job, but expect better by the end of the year on the same book. No grade given at this time on them**. *(did not ask how I would be marked down from a non graded paper, but remembering to hold my tongue)* She does not hand me back mine, but calls me to the front of the room. At this point, I am 10 years old, most of my class is 13/14 years old.  Very self conscience. 

She gave me this look of disgust. I stood there, and she put her hands on my shoulders, as she stood behind me. Announced that **I was not only the youngest one in the school, but the stupidest as well.** Me wide eyed, n looking aghast. She told everyone in the class that **I thought I was so clever to write a report on a book way advance for me.  That she, as a teacher read this book in jr college, and got a B+ on it. and the paper I 'wrote' was memorized straight out plagiarism.  As no one my age could comprehend and write this paper, as it was obviously an A paper.**  I was almost in tears. As I loved the book I wrote about, and read it over and over, knew it front to back. I took a deep breath, and told her, Ms C, I did read it. I love that book. You can ask me anything about it. I can tell you about it.

She got that sheet eating grin on her face.  Asked me about a name mentioned only one time in the entire book, but as I loved that name. Wanted to name my future child that, and sighed, said Pallas Athena.  You could have knocked her over with a feather.  She wrote me up a referral, and sent me down to Mr. M again, as I was  that I was very disrespectful of her authority. 

&#x200B;

TLTR. Teacher punishes me for being advance, shames and bullies me.  I hated school."
Senior Chemistry teacher is very much a textbook enthusiast,"So I’m at the point of being incredibly annoyed with this guy. I’m in senior science (Prelim to HSC in Australia ) and the majority, if not everyone, agrees that a teacher is there to teach and it’s incredibly important coming up to our equivalent of finals.

He copy-pastes from the textbook or Wikipedia (I acknowledge that it can be useful if you need to understand the just of something) straight into a PowerPoint or sets textbook reading, and decided “oh we’ll write a heap of notes” when we have 2 minutes of the period left and not enough info to write notes on. Today was by far the most ridiculous. He set it up to seem as though we’d do a lab but then dumps textbook reading on us and doesn’t help explain it.

At this point, I’m teaching myself Physics and Maths in my own time, and it seems like I’m going to have to add Chem to that workload :("
shitty teacher rants to me about how vaccines are evil and blames me for wasting time,"ok so some backstory, I went to a small catholic school from 4th to 8th and am currently on the summer break heading into 9th. one of my teachers (MS science & 7/8th religion) at the old school  seemed to always find some petty reason to keep my close group of friends and I quiet. almost like a helicopter parent, spending so much time on 1 kid (in this case 4 of us) that the other sibling (the other 11 I our class, I said it was a small school) was never kept in line.

&#x200B;

A few months ago (around march/april) , we were asked a question in religion class, something along the lines of 'what really annoys you about society? I chimed up (as I always do, I was the class's loudmouth) saying 'that some parents wont vaccinate their kids.' Now this teacher, as I stated, already didn't really like me and probably hated my response even more. She went on for 15 minutes (of the 30 min we got for the class) about how vaccines (parentheses next to my response which was quickly shut down):

* were partially made with aborted fetuses; she's extremely pro-life  (sometimes it takes bad to do greater good)
* may cause autism (that was debunked years ago)
* many other things about them being unethical and deadly for infants

At the end of this she blamed me for wasting the rest of class time and being *very rude* or something like that. After class one of my friends come to me and basically reassured me that this was BS. thank god im out of that hellhole and on to greener pastures.

&#x200B;

thanks to u/Tashikani for pointing me to this sub. And for those who may be confused about the abortion thing, im also pro life but I don't support enough to say that some vaccines shouldn't have been made due to dead fetuses."
HE HAS ADHD,"So this took place back in 4th grade. We had a kid in our class let’s call him Mikey, well Mikey has severe adhd but he wasn’t put into special ed. Well one day we had a sub let’s call her Mrs.B. Mrs.B was one of the worst subs ever she even told a student her dress was hideous once. Well you see Mikey was allowed to use the calculators cause he couldn’t even write barely and when he went to go get a calculator she scolded him and told him to sit back down. Me and a couple other people stood up to her saying he needs to use the calculator but then Mrs.B said “Well if you think he’s really that special then you guys can sit out of recess” which didn’t really affect me cause I don’t even play during recess I just draw. The other kids freaked out and sat down. Mikey then proceeded to cry and he got super loud to the point when my favorite teacher came in to see what was happening. When Mrs.B explained the situation she lied a lot she said that we were trying to sneak him a calculator so that he could cheat. The teacher took us and a couple of kids who saw it to ask if it was true. When we confirmed it was false the teacher went to go get the principle who scolded the sub then made her give Mikey a calculator and that once she left the school she would be banned from school grounds. Someone told me they saw her working as a garbage lady in a nearby town. That’s what happens when you don’t listen to people."
Horrible Guidance Counselor,I was bullied in Elementary School so I told the guidance counselor about it. He said if I came to him again with a problem I would be in trouble. Luckily I didn't have any other issues but he shouldn't have told me not to tell him when I have issues.
Lmao what,"My teacher in the middle of the class called somebody the n word. They flipped their shot, obviously, but wow still. She getting fired jeez"
Absolute fuckery,"Okay so there's 3 parts to this teacher story. My class just got our grades back for our art exam and our teacher, to quote is ""disappointed with everyone because when I stopped helping you guys you all went to shit""... Take a hint... Continue helping us then!

AS1. This was one of the worst things that our teacher did. He walked into the room which had lots of students in and sits down beside AS1..
AT: ""so...""
AS1: ""oh no"" *nervous laugh*
AT:""so I was going through your sketchbook and it's good... But...""
AS1: ""can you please not sugarcoat this? I'd just like to know what I've got,""
AT: ""well you could've been amazing""
AS1+everyone else at the table : ""AT don't be mean about this stop building up""
AT: well you could've got an A but you did the final piece on someone's painting rather than an original piece so you don't get an A""
AS1: ""right....""
AT: ""you've got a B because of that final piece, all of your work is great but you've really let yourself down with that final piece""

(written by AS2) AS2 this one happened first, AT came into our lesson and called AS2 out of the room seeming very angry and dissapointed. When they had sat down AT had told AS2 that everything was bad and nothing apart from 1 piece of work was. 
AT: ""right... You have done bad in this project and, for start you chose to do anime as your focus which is bad anyway."" Which is dumb seeing as he told me a 'good' anime to watch when it was actually shit. Anyway. ""As you know we are gonna have to have a couple of lessons to teach you how to paint properly."" As if I didn't already. ""And you had then chose to do manga which is just stupid. Your work as well doesn't link together at all.""
AS2: ""yeah ok.""
AT: ""alright follow me there is something else that is wrong.""
They leave the room and go next door where AS2's final art piece is.
AT: so this is the only good thing that is good is these parts here"" as he point to the two smallest parts of the painting which was larger than a 35 inch TV for size reference. 
AS2: wtf why say that I have done everything wrong then say the two points that don't matter that much are the best parts. Just goes to show doesn't it.

The third story further proves that our teacher is being horrible. He walked into the classroom, came up to me and I asked what my grade was. He replied ""well, your work wasn't brilliant it was a D borderline C but because I'm kind I'll give you a C."" I was happy with this and he left. However later on in the day he comes back into the room and says ""oh, by the way your work isn't good at all, I can't give you a C I'm knocking it down to a D"" and left me to it ....."
My Horrible Teacher..,"Back in 5th grade I had this really horrible teacher.. My teacher was a legit bully to half of my 5th grade class. From extreme belittling, making fun of other classmates, yelling at us and of course having favorites. I've always had a hard time focusing and it definitely wasn't easy with my teacher constantly screaming at me to pay attention. In fact, a research project that i was doing didn't turn out well. A classmate that didn't like me told the teacher i wasn't doing any work and that they were doing it by themself ( this classmate was the teachers favorite ). My teacher proceeded to yell at me and give me a 0 on the project. I also printed out pictures to show my mother what i was researching. My teacher took them and threw them away saying that what i did was stupid and repeatedly asked if i was ""Retarded"". I was embarressed and felt intimidated. Since then half the teachers at that school were fired and replaced.. However i will still not go back to that school.. I regret letting this teacher completely walk all over me. What should i of done? Should i have said something?..

Edit: Crapola.. I feel like i could of added more but, i had so many encounters with this teacher that i picked out one because all of them are pretty bad... My 5th grade teacher was always yelling at me and this may seem unbelievable but, i never really did anything besides not paying attention.. I really had a hard time with focusing.."
How i got my horrible substitute teacher fired...,"Back in the 7th grade, at the end of the school year, we had to take a state provided exam to see if were up to par with the rest of 7th graders in the state. At the time my english teacher had to leave the school for personal reasons (we all thought it was cancer). But to replace him we had a horrible teacher who ill call, Ms.Butt. You see, Ms.Butt didnt like anyone and hated me especially. I was the type of person to say dumb shit and make the whole class laugh. She hated that. And she had it out of for me for the whole time she worked at my school. Sadly for me, she was my classroom tester for when the state exams came around. I was doing my work during the test, not looking around or being suspicious or anything. I started to get a little tired and put my head down for a second (which was encouraged by the states test booklet). When i did, she got up from her desk and came up to me and said from under her breath, as if she was trying not to scream,
 “get, your head, UP”. I did and continued to work on my exam. (Also side note, while these tests are happening, the principle and other school staff walk around and check the classrooms to make sure that no ones cheating or anything, this is gonna come into play soon). So after an hour or so, i put my head down again, knowing that shes gonna come back over, and she does. She gets up from her seat and stomps over to me. Ms.Butt yelled at me to stand up and got in my face. She says some pretty nasty shit to me over the lines of “your a fucking disappointment you know that? You know that your mother is disappointed in having such a fucking horrible child? If you were mine id have you sent away to a different family! (And then she said the thing that cost her teaching career) Your family never should have came to this country!” That was the hitter, my whole class was looking at this point and trying not to laugh, including myself. As she was yelling at me, one of the office lady’s who was put on patrol duty had came in, heard her, left, then came back with the principle, all while she was screaming at me. She asked me, “whats so fucking funny huh?” Then i told her “well dumbass, you just said all of that while the principles in the room”.  My class was asked to leave and to be moved to another room to complete my testing. As we left i made sure to flick her off before i left the classroom. By the time the next school year came around for me (8th grade) The principle had called me to his office to talk about Ms.Butt. All he really said was that he was sorry about her and that he wont let anyone as “nasty as her (yes his words) work at his school again”. Its great that shes never gonna work at a school again. I recently looked her up online and found out that she had a mortgage business that was about to go bankrupt. Sucks for her, but hey, at least i got a cool story on how i got my teacher fired right?"
"Horrible French teacher- lowkey ableist, antivaxx, and transphobic.","Sorry for the format. I'm on mobile.

I'm currently 16, about to enter my junior year of highschool (11th grade). And the TWO SCHOOL YEARS i spent dealing with this teacher was immensely stressful.
It's important to note that:
*I have autism
*I have ADHD
*I have really horrible anxiety

Now, this teacher, we'll call her mrs M, was well- the French teacher.
There isn't much for the 1st year I remember, but theres a BUNCH for the 2nd year.

Meet the cast!

Me-me
F1- friend 1
F2- friend 2
F3- friend 3
F4- friend 4
Mrs m- the teacher
RG- rude girl
(Note: f1, f3, and f4 are all trans. This will come up later)

So, first point: her anti-vaxx stuff.
It was winter, cold and flu season. She started getting off topic as usual. She began to talk about how sickness was spreading around the school. She then said the following: 
Mrs m: i don't give my kids medicine. I use essential oils, gets the sickness right away!
Now, this doesn't mean she's anti vaxx, just annoying. 

HOWEVER.

I have some friends, F1, and F2 (who will both come up later), who told me she said THIS:

mrs m: I don't give my kids shots. Too harmful and expensive.

Second point: her lowkey ableism.
As mentioned before, I have ADHD, anxiety, and autism. I'm enrolled in a program called ""aspiration initiative"", they help kids like me plan their future, do work, etc. I often go here when I'm done with class work or if the noise starts bothering me (sensory issue problems). However, mrs m never let me go there. Which was fine if I just wanted to go after work. However, she never let me go for sensory issues either. One day, we weren't doing anything in class. Kids were all talking at a quiet tone, but it was still enough to bother me. Not to mention, it also triggered a bit of anxiety. 
So, to go to mrs m and ask to go to AI.
she says no, I tell her that the noise is bothering me and she rejects me again.
I return to my seat for a bit, then return again

Me: miss, I really need to go to AI. The noises are bothering me alot.

Mrs m turns to a student.
I should note that this girl had NO disorders at all. Matter of fact, she was also a bit ableist. I was once having sensory overload when she said 
""my cousin has autism and HE doesn't do THAT"". We'll call her RG (rude girl)

So yeah this was yikes.
Mrs m, to RG: is the noise bothering you?
RG, glaring at me: no.
Mrs m, turning to me: if it's not bothering her, it's not bothering you.

So. I spent the entire class period having to put up with both my anxiety and sensory issues.

Along with this, F1 also has autism.

F1 tells me of a time when they had sensory overload, and had to BEG Mrs m to let them go to the bathroom to calm down. Mrs m kept accusing them of overreacting until she finally agreed. Apparently, when they left, she IMMEDIATELY shit talked him about how ""he was overreacting!""

Third point: her transphobia.
As mentioned before, f1, f3, and f4 are all trans.
This was a story told to me by f1 and f2.
They were in class when mrs m was using f1 and f3's dead names. It went like this

F1: miss, my name is [real name], and f3's is [real name]. The names your using is our dead names, and its noted in there that you should use our real, current names instead of our old ones...

Mrs m ignores him, continuing to use the dead names.

F2: miss? Did you hear him?
Mrs m: yes.
F2: why won't you say their real names?

She ignored them again.

Not super dramatic, but this kinda stuff kept happening, no matter how many times they corrected her.

I've also witnessed this with f4, who's also trans. He moved mid year, this happened right before he left.

(For anyone wandering why I have so many trans friends: I'm a member of the schools LGBT+ club. (I'm lesbian), and many trans kids go there for comfort on their dysphoria and family)

Anyway, he was sitting beside me. Mrs m was using she/her and his dead name. My friend decided to tell her since he was leaving soon.

F4: miss, I'm a boy.

Once again, she ignored him.

He tries to tell her a few times. Still ignored.

I then attempt to walk up to her.

Me: mrs m. F4 wants you to call him he/him, and f4, please.
Mrs m, acting like she cant hear me: hm?
I repeat myself

Mrs m: the attendance list says [dead name], so I will say [dead name].

We filed and incident report, and this really it.
Note that everyone was very polite when correcting her.

BONUS:
-she never knew kids names. She'd often point to a kid when calling on them and say ""who's that??""
-she once called on f2. But used the wrong kids name. She was yelling at f2, but using a random other kids name
-she never plans ahead, legit ever.
-Mrs M often went on little tangents about her own life and yadda yadda. She was often distracted by students and would get heavily off subject. Ok yes, it is fun to have occasionally, but it happened so often that we had trouble learning.

So, to end this. She wont be teaching at my school junior year. I dont know if she was fired or what, lots of teachers are leaving this year.
It could be that she was fired, or that she was just leaving because of new rules. 
Either way, she's somebody else's problem now."
Professor tells me to drop a course. I didn't and ended up passing the course.,"This happened to me this past semester.

For context, I am 31 and a transfer student for a Computer Science major. Admittedly, I made some poor choices which lead me to put a hold on taking courses at my local community college.

Some backstory: I worked full time for 4 years at a manufacturing company, which means the company must follow OSHA Rules and Regulations. During this time, I decided to pursue my degree. This company bought out the rights to a piece of equipment from a competitor. This equipment is the same equipment we build but is designed differently than ours. The reason is both companies has different standards for the equipment, hence, the designs were different. One example, our company torque the bolts to 45 ft-lbs whereas the competitor calls for 35 ft-lbs. This will be relevant later.

The story: I was taking 4 courses, 3 of which were on the same days and two, 1pm and 4 pm, were with BT(Bad Teacher). Both courses are programming courses which means a problem can have multiple solutions. The first month went without a hitch. Then came the round of tests for both courses with BT. The tests were back-to-back, which was annoying since there was no study time between courses, but nothing I could do. One thing to note, all the questions didn't ask for a specific answer or way of solving a problem. Then came the test results.

In my 1pm course, I got a C. At first, I was okay with the C. Then I saw how he marked up the test. He took off points for answers that were correct for the question asked because it wasn't ""the best solution"". One example was a program that shows multiples of a number, say 7. I wrote the program by multiplying a counter by 7. While the problem was technically right, it was still wrong because I didn't add 7 to the previous number. 

The 4pm course was the same way. I had gotten a D. On one question, I had to prove the upper and lower bound of a program's running time. I did so using an initial value, but it was still wrong because I ""didn't use induction"".This made me upset. What made it worse, he did the same thing with all of his students and annouced the names of the students who got good grades. Remember the equipment with two standards? Well, I was think that that was bull but didn't say it.

So, I went to his office to talk to hime about my grades. Needless to say, he told me that I should drop the 4pm course, retake it next semester, and get with the TA for the rest of the semester. I told him that I would think about it but never said that I would. After I had left his office, I was talking to one the students who happened to take the same two courses that I was taking. He advised me to stay in the course and so I stayed.

Well, not even a week passed and I ran into him as I had just gotten out of my first class and was headed to my car to head to my 1pm class. He started going off on me saying that I'm wasting time and that I should be with the TAs blah blah blah. When I get a chance to talk, I went off on him saying that I had just walked out of class so wtf. At that point, he backtracks and was like oh so you're not wasting time. Me and some of the students decided to form study groups and learned more in the study groups than we did in class.

Long story short, I ended up getting a B in my 1pm class and a C in my 4pm class."
Dramatic Drama Teacher from Hell,"Hey! I've been putting off posting this because it's another one of those teachers that even thinking about it one year later gives me such anxiety.

WARNING: LONG POST AHEAD!

So this teacher we are going to call ""Ms. Drama Queen"" because my goodness she would make the biggest deal out of the smallest of things!!

She was my drama teacher all throughout middle school and 2 or 3 years of high school.

Now I'm a very introverted person. Drama class was not the best subject to take in my case but for some reason in my middle school it was ""mandatory"".

Anyway. I didn't have any friends in middle school and was heavily bullied by the whole class so before class would start I would be sitting by myself reading a book. When class would start I would put my book away. However, one day I didn't put my book away the very SECOND Ms Drama Queen entered the theatre.

Cast ((hehe get it? Drama teacher?))

DQ: Drama Queen

Me: Me


Me: *sitting there reading*

DQ: *enters the theatre* OP!! PUT THAT BOOK AWAY!!! YOU AREN'T ALLOW TO READ IN CLASS!

Me: *puts it away* Sorry. I didn't realize class had started

DQ: IS THAT TALKING BACK? THAT'S IT! GIVE ME YOUR BOOK!

Me: I-I wasn't talking back.

DQ: *snatches my book out of my bag* You will get this back at the end of class!

Now this wouldn't have been so bad if she didn't do it EVERY. FREAKING. DAY. I would enter the theatre and she would be there waiting and would take my book away. I wouldn't even have it out! Everyone else would be allowed to sit there on their phones but I couldn't sit there with a book beside me?

A couple months later she was putting on the play ""Matilda"" by Roald Dahl. Now I loved that book so I asked to be a narrator because they wouldn't have to be on stage. She agreed. I started to learn my lines but struggled with it. Everytime I would forget a line or mess up on some words she would either say, ""I thought you read the book!"" Or ""With how much you read, I'd think you would actually be good at reading""

Now you could say she was ""trying"" to give me constructive criticism. But numerous times I told her to stop because I was trying and the comments she made were not helping. But she wouldn't stop. Finally I asked if I could just have the book with me so I could read from there just in case I forgot my lines. She reluctantly agreed.

The play went off with no problem. The next day she gathered Everyone who was in the play in the theatre to discuss the play. She made me stand up and basically scolded me in front of EVERYONE about how I ruined the play with my off stage book reading. She said it sounded like I had my lines memorized and apparently that was a bad thing?

 I knew I didn't sound robotic because I had practiced that to make sure. I went home and asked my mom if I could watch the recording of the play she took on her phone. We watched it together and I asked her if I sounded too robotic. She told me ""No"" I was so confused  but I never brought it up.

Fast forward to high school. It is Grade 12. I was convinced by my friends to join them in drama class because then I could be in groups with them. I agreed.

Out first project I was not in a group with my friends but with a girl I knew kinda well. We memorized a scene and practiced it to death.

Because I am high functioning autistic I either memorize things do hard that I can repeat them years later or I can't memorize at all.

So my partner and I have rehearsed this scene for 2 weeks. We are finally presenting to the class. Everything is going well until...my partner skips lines on me.

I get thrown off so I stumbled over my next line because she skipped. I was so upset at myself. I brought it up with DQ after class.

Me: DQ. May I discuss with you what happened during the scene today?

DQ: Yes. I'm taking marks off of your mark.

Me: Wait what?! My partner skipped lines on me. Why am I only losing marks.

DQ: Because you didn't have your lines memorized.

The thing about that argument is that she sat there watching every single rehearsal we did in those two weeks. I never had my script on stage.

Later I asked my partner and I was told that DQ had told my partner it was okay to skip lines in the script and to not worry about telling me. Again I was really mad but I'm a shy introverted person so I didn't do anything about it.

A few months before the end of the year DQ announced to our class that we would be doing a play for all of the other grades as our final exam. She said that if we had a problem or question to bring it up with her before auditions. So I go to her after class.

Me: DQ. I have a problem about the play. *I explained that my mom was sick, I was struggling in English ((see other post)) and was wondering if I could do just backstage work and receive only half marks.*

DQ: That doesn't seem to be a problem! I'll bring it up with the directors. ((The ""directors"" were two other students))

So I leave pleased to finally have a pleasant conversation with DQ. The class auditions for parts. I was away that day but figured since I was doing backstage that it would not be a big deal.

I get to school the next day and DQ hands me a script and said ""Here is your script"" I look at it and she's assigned me 5 PARTS!!! I was upset. I asked to speak to her privately.

We go into her office and I asked her about the conversation we had about how I was dealing with alot of things right now. Her response was..

""Well you seem to be doing fine so why is this a big deal?""

As if me explaining everything the other day had not even happened. At this point I was so stressed out and upset about everything that I started to cry. I desperately tried to explain how there was no way I could do 5 parts and how it was too much to handle but she refused to listen and sent me back out onto the theatre. She wouldn't let me go to the bathroom to stop crying. As I was leaving she threw in that I ALSO had to do sets and props.

The next couple months was actually hell. My group for sets and props consisted of:

1. A guy who NEVER came to class
2. A guy who would just wear headphones and refuses to do anything!

So I was doing sets and props by myself. I tried to talk to DQ about it but she didn't believe me. She was literally no help when I asked for assistance.

For example, we had these HUGE WOODEN background things on the stage. They are on wheels but you aren't allowed to move them alone because they can tip. She wanted me to paint the black. However I could not do it during class time, I couldn't paint them in the theatre, she would not help me get them all the way down to the art room which was across the school and she would not let me into the theatre unless it was class time.

I don't know how she expected me to do all that with the boundaries she gave and the lack of group help. So I didn't get those back sets painted.

Suddenly 2 weeks before the play she tells me that she changed her mind. I was allowed to do just sets and props and to replace my parts in the play I could do lights and music during the play. But this meant she suddenly threw 5 parts to other students 2 WEEKS BEFORE THE PLAY!! Everyone was mad at me because she made it look like a backed out.

After we finish the play performance she met with each group to discuss things that could have been better done. So I went up with the guy who refused to help and DQ started yelling at me.

She was made that the props were lame, sets weren't painted, lights were not bright enough even though I had them on the brightest they could be and how I ""backed out of the play"" I defended myself explaining how I was doing it by myself with some help from my friends even though they had their own projects to do, how I already was dealing with all the other stuff and how I tried my best.

She gave me half marks and the guy who did nothing got full marks as a ""Apology"" from me as she said. I was really upset. I left that class and just broke down.

My friends asked me after class what happened and I explained. They were just as upset as I was. They agreed it wasn't far for her to do that in front of the class like that.

I had the hugest anxiety attack that day and was a mess for a week. Luckily I didn't have to do the last project she came up with because I had my appendix taken out.

So yeah. Sorry for such a long post but there it is. My worse teacher ever."
My nurse who broke the law.,"I once had a school nurse who was just AWFUL. Treated everyone like shit. I’m a type one diabetic, so I needed a lot of medical attention. But when it would be time to bolus or check my blood sugar, she wouldn’t do anything. 

Once I was half and hour late to bolus and had to go home because my sugar was so high. When I told her about this, she stood up in front of my entire class and screamed, “NO! I AM THE TEACHER! YOU ARE THE STUDENT! YOU LISTEN TO ME!” Did I mention I was in 3rd grade?

I put up with this for a while but she never changed. We had meeting where she was specifically called out but said that I needed to learn responsibility. Eventually, in 5th grade, I found out that she didn’t give kids medicine unless they grabbed it from the cabinets. 

WHAT?!

I asked her about *that* and she said, “they have to learn to do it themselves. This was after a kid started crying because he spilled liquid Tylenol on himself and she started screaming. I was done at this point, and started screaming.

“WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU! This is ILLEGAL! How STUPID do you have to be to do this?! YOU ARE AN IDIOT!!!”

I was sent home, but before that, I heard her say “Kids parents probably vaccinated him. That’s how he god Diabetes.” That’s right. She was anti-vaxx. I told my parent and they talked to the nurse who said it was all true, trying to make herself look good. 

We threatened to sue the school for letting this happen, because it was serious. Kids with ADHD and anger issues wouldn’t get their meds. When we played them a recording of the call, they were dumbfounded. They didn’t know it was truly that bad. They fired her and her license was revoked. After that, I don’t know what happened.

TL;DR awful school nurse refused to give medicine to kids unless it was self administered, randomly lashed out at kids, and was Anti-Vaxx. We showed the school a phone call with her and she was fired and is no longer a nurse

Edit: I forgot to mention that once a kid broke their ankle, and when the kid said that they needed to call their parent, the nurse started mimicking her and actually (extremely roughly) started patting her leg. After a week she came back in and said that she had needed surgery."
Guidance counselor and teacher almost cause me not to graduate,"Sorry, this is gonna be a long one.

This happened over 30 years ago and I still think about it often. I went to a public school that didn't really have an AP program, they had ""advanced academic"" classes that could be selected piecemeal. At the end of each year, you got to select your classes for the upcoming school year. I was a slightly above average student through school and preferred taking the basic classes, except for history, I took advanced history classes, which I enjoyed. Every year you got to pick one elective class of your choice, most student took wood or metal shop, or home economics, etc. I always chose a second advance history or second math class.

I hated English and took English 9, 10, and 11 through my first three years of high school. At the end of my junior year, I fill out my schedule and pick English 12. About a week before my senior year starts, I get my schedule and for English I see 'Classical Literature"". I'm thinking that was a mistake and will change that on day one.

First day of class starts and I put in a request for a class change. You had two weeks to make changes to your schedule and it was done through your homeroom teacher. They would take the requests down to the office after homeroom and it took a day for the request to be processed. They were never refused.

I put in my request on day one, most request come in after the first day once a student decides they don't like a particular teacher or class, and as I said they are never refused. I had the same homeroom teacher for two years and got along really well with her. She joked about the day one request and me not even giving the class/teacher a chance. I told her I didn't pick the class, hated English and there was no way I wanted Classical Literature in my senior year.

The next day there was no approval of my change request and my homeroom teacher submitted another with the hand full of others submitted on day two. Day three comes and all other changes are approved and again mine is not. By Friday, my homeroom teacher says she will deliver the paperwork directly to my guidance counselor since I should have been approved several times over by now.

Monday comes and still no approval. By now, I've had a week of Classical Literature and not only do I hate the class I despise the teacher. My homeroom teacher personally escorts me to the guidance counselor this time, with my change class slip. The guidance counselor then proceeds to tell me that he will not change my class because I need an ""AP"" English class because I've taken ""AP"" History and Math classes and it will look better on my college resume. I was already accepted to a nearby University with a partial baseball scholarship and planning to major in History. He absolutely refuses to change my schedule.

The next day my Mom (single parent, dirt poor, got pregnant with me in 10 grade and dropped out of school to have me) and I are there in a meeting with the guidance counselor and the principal. They are being total douche bags about switching me out of the class. My Mom knows I do not want to take this class in any way shape or form. You need four English credits in order to graduate and I knew I'd have no trouble passing English 12 and didn't want to worry about it. They literally argued with my Mom about this for a couple of hours before they finally agreed to allow me to switch classes, effective on Monday of the next week.

So, at the start of the next week I get switched to English 12. The class is easy, the teacher is great, and I actually enjoy the class. Fast forward to the end of the first semester and I get my report card. I get an A in English 12... and an ""Incomplete"" in Classical Literature. What? A class I only had for two weeks at the beginning of the year and switched out of right at the deadline to be able to switch.

What this means is that my grade for English will be an ""Incomplete"", even if I get four A's in English 12, which I do accomplish.

Once again my Mom has a meeting with the guidance counselor, the principal, and the Classical Literature teacher. She is pissed that I was allowed leave her class on the Monday after the two weeks were up. She is also pissed I didn't do a term paper. Term papers aren't even discussed in her class until the third semester and the term paper is sort of the ""final exam"" of the class. It was explained that I was given permission in the middle of the previous week but just didn't take affect until Monday. She didn't care and wasn't changing the grade. My mom argued for a bit and then sort of gave in. She told me the school wouldn't allow that to happen and to just wait and see what happens.

I went through the next three semesters of my senior year thinking I wasn't going to graduate. The only fun thing about it was whenever I saw the Principal or Guidance Counselor in the halls between classes I would call them every curse word in the book, loudly, in front of all the other students in the hall. They never did anything to me about it and I became legend because of it.

Fast forward to graduation time and my Mom is back in touch with the school asking if they are really going to fail me in my senior year for a failing grade in a class I didn't even have. They said there was nothing they could do. My Mom goes to the Principal one more time, the day before graduation, and threatens to sue the school district and go the local press about what has happened. The principal then hands my Mom a list with 100 book titles on it and says if I have a ten page term paper on his desk, tomorrow at 7AM, and it is a gradable paper, I can graduate.

My mom gets home mid afternoon and tell me this, like I had any chance of doing so. I look over the list and it is 90 percent fiction and then the last few books are non-fiction history books. I have read them all and one of them very recently. Now I've done ""book reports"" before but never a term paper. One of my best friends had graduated the year before and was a top student at our school and I have played baseball with him since little league. He came over and gave me a quick rundown on how term papers are written and stayed up with me all night to get this this written. When I was done, he said it was not only gradable, it would get a good grade.

I go to bed at 6AM on graduation day, still not knowing if I will graduate. My Mom takes the term paper to the principal, he looks surprised as he looks it over but says I cannot graduate. She says that I did what he said I needed to do, and he actually has the balls to say, ""Yes, but I didn't think he would actually be able to do it.""

At that point my Mom actually reaches over and grabs his phone and calls the lawyer and hands the phone to the principal. My Mom comes home, wakes me up and says go shower and get dressed your graduating in a few hours.

I get to the graduation ceremony and all the other students are standing around waiting to be paired up and lined up, there was a buzz when everyone saw me because by this time it was well know what was going on. About a half hour before we were going to graduate the principal drives up near where I'm standing, looks pissed and reaches under the front seat of his vehicle and hands me a crumpled up bag with my cap and gown in it. With the entire graduating class watching I loudly order him to take it across the street to a dry cleaner/laundry and have it ironed. He takes it and storms off, the entire class cheers.

As we are paired off and getting ready to march in to graduate, three fellow students come running from the parking lot, wearing very wrinkled gowns, lol. They all come rushing to me and give me hugs and said they were only graduating because of me. Apparently, when the Classical Literature teacher found out I was going to graduate, she changed the grades on the three students who she had failed during the year. One was her own nephew."
Deputy head teacher shoots pupil with powerful toy gun.,
I almost got a urinary infection due to my Bad Teacher (graphic),"Little information: I had a history of track infections where I would have the need to pee when ever I went to the bathroom, nothing came out and when it did it was very little and hurt alot.

This was in health class a while back and in still fuming. Our health teacher was super bad at his job.

1. He would'nt stick to one subject; he would teach about drugs and alcohol then give us a project about sexist ads in the next class.

2. He was out of shape; his nickname was triple chin [teachers name] because of how fat he was even though he taught health AND gym

3. He was horrible at grading; I would be getting 100s in classwork (even though we never got any) when I was on my phone (he never noticed) and boys who were talking got 80s

Idiot Teacher: IT (yes I know Pennywise.)

Okay, onto the story.
We were presenting projects and about 3 people asked to go to the bathroom at different times. I guess IT took this as people finding excuses to get out of class cuz then this happened;

Me: *raises hand* Can I go to the bathroom, IT?

IT: Are you kidding me? Just wait.

I was dumbfounded. The HEALTH teacher was telling me to hold in my urin because he thought he was being so smart and figured out that kids were leaving his class just to leave his clas because OF COURSE PEOPLE DONT USE THE BATHROOM

I waited, thinking he would let me at some point but NOPE. I didnt want to confront him because it was only a 10 more minutes and I knew he would bring that up, but I. NEEDED. TO. PEE.

I figured, screw it. I raised my hand

Me: Can I go to the bathroom?

IT: What did I tell you? Wait.

You're giggling me.

When it was my turn to present a few minutes later and the whole time I was trying send him signals that I needed to go by squirming while presenting, but he never took the hint. I could feel my body getting ready to just piss all over the floor, but thankfully I was potty trained and my I wasnt able to pee anywhere but in a toilet unless my organs were about to burst.

As soon as he said class was over, I ran to ask our real teacher if I could go and OF COURSE he says yes. I run to the bathroom and guess what? It hurts to pee. 

Health was our last class so after I'm done packing I go back to the bathroom to not only use it again, but call my dad. I tell him eveything and he says he will call the school. Luckily, I didnt get a infection, but I wish I did so I could get that cunt fired becuase everyone hated him as much as I did and it was about time he got fired.

The next day, do you know what happened? Nothing.
All that happened was IT told me that if I ever needed to use the bathroom in his class again I could go without asking.
The fuck? 
I almost get a urinary track infection and this dick dosent even get suspended from his job?
Fuck school.

TLDR: My health teacher makes me hold in my pee until I almost get infected and he isnt even get reprimanded.

Edit: I fixed some typos. I was furious when I first wrote this and didnt notice."
My 5th grade teacher,"Some background: Before 5th grade, I went to a private school, meaning this was my first year at a school where grades matter.

Onto the stories!

Story #1

Mr S (Not his real initial), before I got there, had a kid reach for something that was obviously too high up. When the kid fell back up after jumping, his leg was sliced by something (I forgot if it was a sword or whatever) down to the muscle, and, though Mr S never was asked to remove it, he never did remove it. As far as I know, that sword or sharp object is still there to this day. 

Story #2

He was extremely biased, and put all the ""well-behaved"" kids up front, and, since I was struggling to follow his lesson, he stuck me in the back, even though he knew that I needed glasses. 

Story #3

A follow up to the biasedness, he made a speech and  one of his points (he was NOT joking) was that all people from [insert place name] were litterers (I forgot exactly what it was but it had to do with trash). I told him after class that his statement was not true and that some of my family lives in [place name] and his follow up was ""well, they're probably litterers, too"". 

Story #4

One day Mr S was talking about personal hygiene. I didnt realize why until after class the next day he said that I smelled. Too my face. Too be fair, it was true, but there was better ways he could've handled it. Ex: talking to my parents first or just telling me that I needed to shower more. 

Story #5

I wanted to make a good impression at my first year in public school, so I made sure to be on time every day. In the system, you go to ""flag ceremony"" (announcements for school news and pledge of allegiance.), then walk to your class, THEN take roll. However, Mr S apparently didnt like that, so he takes roll before we walk to the class. I was marked up three weeks in a row as tardy, so in retaliation, for the rest of the year, I fake sick a grand total of 2 and a half weeks. 

Story #6

Mr S had this lifesize doll right outside his door named Mr 0 (again, not the manequinn's real name). He decorated it with ""swag"" and such, but if you so much as looked at Mr 0 the wrong way, Mr S would give you a detention. I accidentally tripped on Mr 0 and knocked him out of his chair, so Mr 0 gave me 2 detentions. The 2 days I was supposed to go to detention, I faked sick. (This, along with me being ""tardy"" was the reason my citizenship grade was lowered). And no, he was too lazy to reschedule the detentions. 

Additional Stories

These are just me getting back at Mr S for being a bad teacher.

 I stole one of Mr 0's ""items of swag"" everyday for the rest of the year. Mr S was furious. 

Again, I skipped a combine total of 2 and a half weeks (including 2 detentions). 

A couple friends were talking about who we would miss over the summer, then switched to who we wouldn't miss. I said (loud enough for him to hear) that I wouldn't miss Mr S. 

Just needed to vent. Also, he never took any time after class or during lunch to help anyone. I've heard of worse teachers, but this is my personal least favorite teacher."
My English Teacher in Middle School Wrote Me Up For M***urbating,"I have autism (specifically Aspergers) and growing up was really difficult. I often did things or said things without thinking about them and it caused a lot of problems. I was 11 years old and I hadn't had the sex talk with my mom yet. I had NO IDEA what masturbating even was. I was sitting in class and that day, I happened to be wearing sweatpants. (For context, I have always suffered from really bad anxiety and picking my nails to the skin was a really bad habit I had.) If you've ever had an itch with sweatpants on and understand how difficult it is to scratch through it without nails, I'm sure you can guess where this is going. I reached into my sweatpants ON THE SIDE near my thigh and started to scratch. My teacher looked right at me and I caught her looking at me so I just stared back, unaware of what was going through her head. A couple days later, I received a write up that I was instructed to take home for my mom to sign. I read the write up but I had no idea what the word masturbating meant. (The full write up said that I exposed my pubes and started masturbating in the middle of class and when she looked at me horrified I just stared at her while still doing it.) The moment my mom saw it, SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY PISSED. She started talking about how she was going to sue the school and the teacher and then asked me if I knew what masturbating meant. I immediately started crying because to my 11 year old brain, I thought it was some kind of disease. She then stated that it was something you did with your genitals for pleasure. I was horrified and confused. I couldn't understand at the time how that was even a thing. I ended up getting two weeks of in school suspension for that, even after my mom went in to see the principal, absolutely raging and threatening to sue. (She never did otherwise this would probably be posted in r/NuclearRevenge.)"
Emotional trauma for a Lesson,"I have a weak coping mechanism when it comes to any confrontation. Comedy, I'd try to make jokes and make light of situations. So I crack jokes when I'm down as I would rather not have people worry about that. 

My fifth-grade teacher resented this. So when she thought I was a distraction or ""clowning it up."" (As she would yell) I would be called to the front of the class, in front of all my peers, and would get a lecture and degraded, and would end up on the brink of tears. I would try to laugh it off when I went to my desk to cope. She would then grab my hand and pull back to the front of the class. Ask the class, ""What did (my name) do wrong?"" Not having many friends due to what we later learned was autism, it became a lesson on itself. 

Kids knew I was riled up quickly, and my teacher encouraged it. Saying ""Now (Student's name) don't be like (my name)."" She was using my autism, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem issues as a teaching method. 

Some of her lessons

-Do your homework, or you'll end up like (my name), worthless. 
-The world doesn't revolve around you (my name). Just because you're crying doesn't mean anyone should care.
-If (My name) hit you, tell me! Bullying isn't allowed. [I never fought any students and was physically weaker than most students]

I had it and started skipping school, for about three days until my parents found out. On the third day, I was found out and sent to the principals with my dad in the room. Justice was kind of served...? My teacher explained her ""behavior lessons,"" to my father and he didn't have it. He demanded that I moved classes, although it was too late in the year for it to matter. The damage was done, the best the school could do was give us some names to a psychologist and therapist nearby. 

I am excited for senior year; we have to go to our old elementary and middle schools. When I see her, I will let her know I wasn't worthless. Two more years~"
"Teacher says my anxiety is ""for attention""","This was in fourth grade. Also, don't comment about how ""kids don't have anxiety"". Let's meet the cast. 

Me:me ET: evil teacher OS: Other students

So it was a normal day at school when I get in trouble at lunch for something I hadn't done. (Also, at this point, my parents were looking for someone to diagnose me) I got in about as much trouble as a fourth grader could. (no recess, sit in corner, etc.) 
We get back to class from recess and I'm crying. At first, it is just a little, but it eventually gets to anxiety attack level and I am full on sobbing in the middle of class in front of everyone. Then, this happens. 

Me: gasping from sobbing 
OS: staring at me
ET: No one look at her! She is just doing it for attention! 
Me: starts gasping more while trying to stop more. Starts glancing around room at my classmates. 

(BTW, that wasn't exaggerating. She literally YELLED) For the rest of the year, she continued to suck. For the rest of elementary school, I would see her around and she would SMILE at me. I know that I am overreacting a little but still."
Math teacher bullies student for being stupid and won't help the student,"I was in accelerated math (you learn 2 grades at once) and my math teacher hated me for some reason, in the last month of summer we were given 60 packets of homework we had to do (we had to teach our selves the concept, it was to see how good we were at math) i found out about it 2 months into the school year and had to do it over a weekend. After that he bullied me saying that his class was for the top 5% of the smartest kids and that i should drop it because i am the bottom 5%(i was recommended into the class by many teachers and have been into math for many years) and a whole bunch of stuff like that. I had to work really hard to get even a B in good class, and in his class you failed after a B(it went straight to 80% being a B to 79% being an F, i wish i could've had some revenge story or something, but i just dropped the class and didn't have to do math for the rest of the year (i had already finished my grades math requirements so they let me go without it), this teacher also wouldn't help you with anything, you'd ask him a question and he'd tell you to watch a video when you got home, or that you should have listened in class, and over all sucked at teaching math in the first place, he would make it wayyyy too complicated."
My asshole 8th grade teacher,"I had trouble making friends and still struggle with that. My teacher in 8th grade had made my year worse. She hated me I could tell. She humiliated me in class she also said she “it’s hard to like you guys if guys don’t listen to me”. One day in class we were supposed to make a group for a puppet play everyone had already made a group,I struggled with making friends and actually joining them. I had joined a group and asked the teacher if I could join another group she said this group was fine. This was the end of the year I didn’t give a shit about anything a person said or did. She said out of the blue “You have no friends because your to bossy”  I replied confused excuse me what. She said it’s true. I have never been bossy in my life and in other words she was the bossy one. I never want to see her again and hope she never does that to anyone again."
The Worst Kindergarten Teacher,"For context, I have Autism. My parents moved states and there were no special ed class that didn't cost an arm and a leg, meaning I had to go to public school. I ended up in Ms. W's class, there is a list of things that my family came to dislike her for.  


\-during my first week, i had to use the bathroom during a lesson. being from a special ed school, i had no idea what raising your hand meant, so i just sat there until i couldn't hold it. she was extremely upset about it and made it clear to me how she felt about it. i remember being so embarrassed and ashamed as i got walked across the school to the principal's office in pee soaked pants to get a pair from there.

&#x200B;

\-during MLK day we had a coloring sheet that had MLK himself sleeping in a cute bed and dreaming of the children of the world holding hands. I colored one of the kids purple. She saw this and told me ""Look around this room. Do you see any purple kids?"" and made me redo it, while also making me move my car to yellow light (we had one of those sticker systems where each time you misbehaved, your little car moved down to yellow and then to red.)

  
\-she told my mom she was holding me back because i didn't know how to read. my mom was baffled because i was sitting next to her reading the Sunday paper out loud. they argued for a bit until Ms W said ""Well, I don't know what you want me to do, she refused to read the material so-"" my mom stopped her, ""Wait, her refusing to read and her not being able to read are two different things!"". they got me a separate setting and let me choose the book to read, and it turns out i was reading at a 2nd grade level.

&#x200B;

\-my pet dog had jumped off our back deck and broke every, and had to be put down. this was my first time dealing with death, i was devastated and cried every night in my mom's lap for a while. my teacher told my mom two weeks later that i was still acting depressed about the death and that wasn't okay, so Ms. W got a counselor to get a kid's book where a kid's dog dies and he goes through the process of grief. unsurprisingly, i got hysterical halfway through the reading."
My teacher does nothing,"My teacher allows us to turn in assignments months late with no points removed. She gives us homework about things she never taught us and we haven't learned a thing this year.  She also has never given any student detention.  Here are the things they have done; 
1. Stand on top of desks dancing
2. Have paper airplanes battles
3. Watch YouTube and go on their phones
4. Skip classes by hiding in her class
5. Wrestle 
6. Hit people
7. Yell and chase people
I'm really surprised she didn't do anything about people hitting each other. Most teachers would give a detention to students for hitting each other,  which would make sense."
Microsoft Office is the best web Browser money can buy,"Back in high school I had a computing teacher who I was fairly sure was somewhat winging his lessons.

One day we had to sit an online test of about 20 questions that were written by our teacher and were told that we couldn't google the answers or talk to anyone, fair enough but the test was very poorly written, one of the questions I remember was:

Which of the following programs is a web browser?

A.  Microsoft Excel
B.  Paint
C.  Microsoft Word
D.  Minesweeper

Of course the problem with this and some other questions was that there was no right answer available, Microsoft Word was listed as the correct answer but of couse as anyone can tell you it is not a web browser, it's a word processor.
I brought this question up to my teacher but he just said that he couldn't help us with the test and just left me to guess (I chose paint).

A few other questions were like this, and some questions seemed right but the answer was wrong, like one question that asked what http stands for, it stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol but the test said the correct answer was something like Highertext Typing Protocol.

I managed to pass the test but failed a good few questions thanks to the teacher writing a poor test, but instead of correcting anything he just said that we should study harder in the future."

You may have paid to win a prize but you can't have them,"Back when I was is school around 15ish years ago we held some kind of event every summer where the students would run stalls we would sell things that had been donated, kind of like a car boot sale but we were only selling to other students.  It was some kind of donation raising thing where we would sell things to improve our school.

I can't remember every stall we had, I remember there was a games room where you could pay £5 for 15 minutes on a Playstation 1 with a selection of about 5 games, face painting, snack shop and some various other things.

The one I do remember clearly though was the raffle they had set up, the raffle was only available to the students that were running the stalls and cost £1 for a ticket with the prizes being some of the better donations the school had recieved, well I bought 10 tickets and waited until the end of the day when the drawing would occur.

Out of my 10 tickets I managed to be lucky enough to win three different items, a tiny calculator on a keyring, a large box of art pencils, and a £50 voucher to Grooves.  Grooves by the way was a store that sold music CDs and games, our town didn't have a dedicated games store so this was the only play we could buy them.

Well anyway after I won my first prize which was my tiny calculator that I'm pretty sure no one would care about, my teacher decided that winning more than one prize wouldn't be fair on the others that had also paid for their tickets and proceeded to redraw and give my prizes to other students instead despite me having paid actual money for my tickets.

I complained of course but was told that the other students had paid and it wouldn't be fair if they didn't get anything andhad to settle with my little calculator.

There was a happy ending though, as consolation for missing out on the other prizes I had won my teachgave me a liquorice allsort, not a bag of them though, just a single liquorice allsort which I think was the yellow coconut one, another way of saying that is that my teacher was eating a bag of sweets and decided that giving me one sweet was equivalent in price to my other prizes."
My grade 9 English teacher gives me a bad mark on an assignment purely because she disagrees with my statement,"This happened on Tuesday of this week. I had to write a persuasive speech on a topic of our choice as a final assessment of our debate unit. I choose a very controversial topic, I chose to write my speech on why the wage gap isn’t because of sexism. I made various points, backed them up with statistics and some pieces of scholarly articles and I analyzed them. My speech was a little over four minutes long which was in the recommend time span(3-5 minutes). Right after my speech was finished she (my teacher) started accusing me of using false information, and saying that she was going to check all of my research that night. It turns out that I didn’t site one of my points in the final copy that I handed into her, she then proceeded to give me 1 out of 5 for my sources. In total I ended up with a 6 out of 10 on that assignment."
The time i played ultimate catch up because I had to take time off to heal from surgery,"Long title I know but that is the best way to summarize the situation. I told my friend this story and he told me that I should post it somewhere, so here I am about to tell you mine by far worst school experience I've ever had.

It all happened between semesters during my freshman year at high school. My family decided they wanted to go out on a vacation at a cabin we had rented, we all had fun for the first two days of our intended weeklong vacation. 

The vacation was cut short because I felt the worst pain I had ever felt in my hip, I could barely move and my parents took me to the hospital which was 3 hours away from the cabin and at first told me I had sprained muscles in the left side of my body and that I should rest and keep up feet up and try not to move. So my family decided to go home and I relaxed as much as I could being in agonizing pain. My parents decided, after seeing me literally crying on the bathroom, to take me back to the hospital where they decided to do an X-ray and they found I broke my left hip and they told me it was bad enough that I would need surgery to place a metal plate to help the bone. Long story short got a month off school while I recovered and then another month off because apparently, it wasn't healing properly. 

Long story short I missed a lot of schools, now here is where the horror of this story begins. 

My parents really worried about my grades and wanted to make sure everyone was on the same page, went to the school and requested a meeting to explain my absences and hopefully set up a program so all my teachers could help me catch up. And everything was set in stone or so I thought

I come into school and every teacher expressed their sympathies and gave me packages so I could get caught up quick and easy, well almost every teacher gave me some sort of package to get me caught up. The teacher that didn't was my science teacher and for anonymity, we will call her Mrs. Bryne or Burn for short. Mrs. Byrne proceeds to ask me why I was gone for two months and I proceed to explain that I had surgery done on my hip and that I needed to let my hip heal. She nodded and when I asked for a work package so I could get caught up, she gave me a fake smile and said: "" Don't worry OP you will have your package tomorrow"".

As many would guess, tomorrow came and went and when I asked after class I got the exact same response from Mrs. Byrne.  I had no clue what I was doing with the work because when Mrs. Byrne taught she would teach the basics of the course first and then dive into more complex stuff and since I wasn't around for the basics I had no idea what I was doing.

3 and a half months went by and midterms came and went, Still I had not gotten the catch-up package despite asking over and over for the package so I could know what was happening.  With a tiny bit of help from the smart kid in my class, I was able to pull off a %40 in the course and Mrs. Byrne told me she wanted to speak to me at lunch.

So I go and sit down at a desk close to Mrs. Byrne, I am still confused as to why she called me there and a huge part of me hoped she was going to give me the package of work she promised me back in January or she would teach the material to me herself.  Well, I was in for quite a surprise when Mrs. Byrne looked at me with an angry look on her face and told me something I still get livid about today every time I tell this story. She looked me dead in the eyes and told me  "" OP you are failing and I don't expect you to pass my class this semester"".  At that moment I was clenching my fist under the desk and I told her "" I am failing because I have not gotten the package of work you promised me almost 4 months ago"". 

Mrs. Byrnes looks at me and tells me "" Well it is your responsibility to come to me so you could get caught up"". I got furious, I still cannot recall a time I have been madder in my life. I screamed at her and said, "" I ASKED YOU FOR THE FUCKING WORK PACKAGE OVER AND OVER, DID I GET IT?"" ""NO, I FUCKING DIDN'T, APPARENTLY IT IS MY FAULT FOR FAILING DESPITE TRYING TO GET HELP, I EVEN ASKED FOR TUTORING BUT YOU NEVER WERE AVAILABLE""

Mrs. Byrnes looked at me with a unimpressed look on her face and asked me "" Are you done?"" After I screamed at her. Then she explained or thought she told me this "" You skipped for two months, I haven't provided help because next time you are going to come to school aren't you?""

That was the final nail in the coffin and i got up in a blind rage, i vaguely remember being shouted at to sit down.  But i ended up leaving and going to sit on the bench at my school to just cool down and when the principal came out they got me to talk with Mrs. Byrne and told her that, I did indeed deserve the package and never skipped. So I took the package and ended up squeezing half a semesters work into 3 weeks. I ended up passing the class with a 70%

MFW teacher doesn't give me work because she thought i skipped and was explicitly told that I had to heal"
My awful History/Geography/Religion teacher,"Hello to you all:

I’ve enjoyed reading a lot of the stories here and I want to share my own. Bare with me, because I’m from Spain and the levels/classes are a little bit different from the USA and UK. Also, this is going to be pretty long, so prepare yourselves!!

Little bit of backstory: My school was a concentrate centre (I don’t know how to translate it). Basically, it was a cooperative of parents who bought some shares and built the school. The school itself offered all the levels from kindergarden up to bachiller (high school? I was 18 when I finished). The teachers were mostly okay, but there was one among them who made his mission to make our life a living hell. She would be known as Ms. Satan.

This teacher was OLD. I mean your grandma kind of old. She always wore the same outfit to school, no matter the weather. There was a joke among my classmates that she came as a pack with the school. She had been teaching for forever (she even gave class to my uncle and she was already old by that time [my uncle is 35+ years older than me]) and everyone hated her face.

She “taught” the 3 subjects that I put in the title. I say “taught” because we were forced to learn everything BY HEART. And not only that, you had to recite the lessons EXACTLY like it was in the book. Trying to learn in a different way or saying thinga with your own words resulted in yelling and extra homework. Imagine being a 9-10 year old and crying every time you had to study for her exams. She also made us copy maps from our books into our notebooks and, if you made a mistake, she would rip the page out and make you start over again.

Luckily, my parents were pretty understanding when it came to her. I even remember them asking to see her and yelling at her for her bs. My dad really helped me with my homework and it’s the reason I eventually passed her subjects.

But the worst thing by far that she did was in the last year that I had with her. It was the final religion exam and I made my mission to make her put a 10 in my exam. She was known for not having put a 10 in her whole life, but I was determined. I studied my butt off, memorising all the data and was able to recite everything backwards, so I was pretty confident. The day of the exam I wrote everything very carefully, as I knew she took points for bad handwriting. After spending 15 minutes revising, I handed her my exam smiling and told her that I couldn’t wait for my grade.

After 1 week I received the grade and was mortified to find a big 9 in the front. I read all my exam, but everything was correct. One friend even checked for me and couldn’t find anything wrong. But then we saw it. In the middle of the test that I wrote was a small red letter, as I had put an “a” instead of an “e”. I felt my world crumble as I saw her smiling ear to ear. I was furious and, when I showed the exam to my parents, they demanded her to change my grade.


However, nothing came from it. My grade wasn’t changed and she continued to teach there until she retired 8 years later. I heard that she died alone, with nobody by her side. I’m not an awful person, but still today I think that she got what she deserved. She was a miserable person that made everybody miserable, so good riddance, Ms. Satan, I hope that it was worth it.

I have a couple of more horrible teachers (one from secondary school and other from university), so, if you are interested, I will post about them"
My Seventh-Grade Teacher: A Saga,"First Reddit post, be kind, for once not on mobile, blah blah blah

On to the horrors of seventh grade!!

My class was advanced, so we learned everything in the regular seventh-grade curriculum and a bit of eighth grade.

Well. Miss Dodd took that requirement very seriously. She constantly reminded us how little time we had to learn, up until the last day of school. It wasn't even gentle reminders. She was always screeching about ""we need to learn this in a week! Otherwise, we won't get to the extended part of seven-extended!""

Despite my status as one of her favorite students, I always loved it when I got put in the back corner, because then it was harder for her to yell at me. And she liked to yell a lot. I would wonder how she made it through the day without losing her voice. And every time she yelled, I always wanted to curl up into a ball and cry. 

We had one homework assignment that was for a project grade. Homework should count for 10% of your grade; this counted for 40%. She didn't tell us about it until two classes before three of them were due. ""Didn't I tell you you had to get these done? Didn't I stand right here and say that you had to do these?"" Thank God she moved the due dates after literally everyone in that class yelled ""NO!""

She was the only teacher who made me cry. I'm generally pretty headstrong, so this was quite the achievement. She was so patronizingly condescending, it was frustrating to even ask to go to the bathroom. ""Well, why didn't you go earlier, in homeroom?"" ""Oh, Michael! You did your homework for once in your school career!"" ""deepfriedjeans, you need to get this done, or you'll get a lower overall grade for the semester!"" That kind of stuff. It was disgusting to have an old woman smile at me and explain what I'd already figured out the year prior.

For reference, and what I probably should've mentioned earlier, is that she turned 63 this year. It was concerning. I fear for the future generations, despite our collective status, which happens to be ""fuck you miss dodd, it's summer""."
A slightly disturbing story about a long-term Spanish substitute.,"*Names changed to protect the identities*

Last year in Spanish 2 we had three different teachers because Smith was on maternity leave. Our second teacher was Johnson who was terrible at Spanish and was a terrible teacher. On her first day she got a basic Spanish word wrong and this guy corrected her so she sent him to the principal's office. This guy is really tall with platinum blonde hair and really icy blue eyes. He is also really aggressive and blunt towards teachers when they piss him off. When he got sent to the principal's office we all backed him up and told her that he was correct and didn't deserve getting sent to the principal's office. Our principal sent him back because he knew he did nothing wrong but she punished us by making us write sentences. He payed $15 to some website to find out where she lived and some other personal stuff and sent a ""friendly"" letter to her. Yes, I know this was wrong, but it was kinda funny.

A few days later, I sliced (almost severed) my finger on the side of a table. I waited until she was finished talking before raising my hand. My finger was bleeding all over my clothes and arms. I showed her what had happened and she straight up yelled at me about how I was disrupting her class. She wouldn't let me go to the nurse's office but she made me go to the bathroom to clean up the mess I made. I went to the office the next class period to report her and to get my finger fixed up.

Johnson eventually got fired and sued for dragging a 6th grader to the office and hitting his head against a wall, resulting in a concussion."
Stupid teacher hates me for no reason (2 different short stories),"Ok, so first off, English is my first language so yell at me for typos and I'm on mobile blah blah blah

Cast:
ST - stupid teacher that no one likes
Me - guess who

So I was in fifth grade when i had this teacher. I had her for math and science.

Some background info: no one liked this teacher and the only 2 people she liked were this really smart girl that moved from china (who i later became best friends with) and a fourth grader who was taking the highest fifth grade class but even they hated her. In the beginning of the year she really liked me and was always joking around with me even though i was scared of her.

In math class one day i missed half of the lesson cause i was in a band sectional. I got back to class at the end of the lesson so i didnt really understand what was going on. After class had ended i went up to ST so she could explain the lesson to me.

Me: ST, I missed the beginning of class cause i had a sectional. Could you please explain the beginning of the lesson?

ST: NO! YOU SHOULDNT HAVE MISSED MY CLASS. IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BAND CAUSE BAND IS NOT GRADED (it is) AND MY CLASS IS.

Me: but-

ST: I DONT WANNA HEAR IT. ASK A FRIEND TO HELP YOU OR SOMETHING.

I didnt really make a big deal out of this. I just got some notes from my friend and forgot about it.

Next story:

This was later that year. I was going on a trip across the world so i was gonna be gone for about 2 weeks. My mom and i both asked in advance for the work i was gonna miss so i could do it on the plane or something. ST happily agreed. She never gave me the work.

After i got back from my trip she gave me all the papers i had missed in 2 classes for 2 weeks. (It was a lot.) She also expected me to finish it in 1 night which of course i didnt after staying up really late that night and my parents each did a few worksheets to help me. I still didnt finish.

The next day:
ST: WHY DIDNT YOU FINISH YOUR PAPERS? I GAVE YOU 2 WEEKS.

Me: no ST you gave me one night. It wasnt enough. Im sorry.

ST: WELL YOURE JUST GONNA HAVE TO STAY IN DURING RECESS.

Me: yes maam.

I stayed in during recess to finish all of my papers and our recess was short so it took about a week. I told my mom about ST and she was really mad and complained to the school but they didnt help at all.

Sorry about my extensive ranting but it was nice to get that off my chest even though its been a few years. (Im in 8th grade)"
Teacher helps make me give up wanting to be an artist,"This happened about 15 years ago when I was about 13-14.

As a little background I grew up in a small harbour town and the town had a lot of people working either in fish factories or with the boating companies in someway, so the shipping industry was very important to our town.

One day it was announced that the towns largest ferry would be retired in place of a newer model, this upset many people and so to honor the older ship it was decided that they would hold an art competition with the students from school in town where the students would draw or paint something that reflects the town and the 2 people that had the best pictures would have their photos in the local news paper, their pictures on display on the new ferry, and a tour and meal onboard the new ship.

Now it should also be mentioned that the teachers of the winners would also receive these prizes as well (Aside from the picture in the ship of course) and so instead of being a competition that you could choose to enter, ther teachers decided to make the competition mandatory work instead. 

I was wanting to be an artist from a young age and so of course I entered anyway, our teachers brought us into the town square by the harbour and told us to find something to draw for our painting.

I chose to paint one of the smaller ships that was docked in the harbour, so I sat down to draw it and then paint it later back in the classroom.

Well the day comes when they're announcing the winners and I'd manage to win first place for my painting so I was pretty happy.

The only problem was that I was that kid that everyone picked on and bullied, I was from a poor family, didn't have any of the popular named brand clothes and my own clothes were pretty badly damaged because my parents wouldn't buy me new ones and I had seldom any friends.

I'm also autistic which the school knew about and a teacher actually called me a retard to my face because of it, and this is also a large part of why I was bullied because the teachers decided to out me to people so I wouldn't infect them with my autism.

Well my teacher came up to me and said in no uncertain terms that while I had indeed won first prize, she didn't want me to appear in the newspaper because it would tarnish the schools reputation because I was poor and that another richer student would be better, so instead 1st place was given to the 3rd place picture, 2nd place kept their prize, and I was given 3rd prize which was to have my painting displayed in the local art gallery.

Except that there was no third place in this competition, everyone that entered the competition got their picture in the local art gallery.

So after this competition I just gave up on art, I used to enter art competitions all the time and went to many art workshops as well, but decided that it didn't matter anymore because no matter what I did no one would ever see or respect my work at all.

I will add that this wasn't the only thing that made me quit, there were other things like my parents tearing up my portfolio as punishment for not doing the dishes correctly, having my other works ignored in competitions simply because the teachers didn't like me, and of course getting no recognition from anyone about my work regardless of how good or bad it was, but this competition made me just quit entirely because I couldn't see the point in doing something no one would appreciate and no matter how hard I tried no one would accept me because I wasn't popular enough for them.

Well that was all about 15 years ago and I am now a successful artist with my works in a few galleries, yay!

No not really, I'm actually living on very generous benefits because of my autism and I've moved away from my home town and stay at home all day so I don't infect anyone with my deadly autism.  So um, happy ending?"
You can't have friends because of your autism,"As a child about 20ish years ago I had a handful of friends, about 5 or 6, can't quite remember, and this is how I lost all of them.

I was in Primary school at the time and at some point I had been diagnosed with autism, I asked what that meant but no one would tell me because they said I wouldn't understand because of my autism.

Well people with autism were very heavily despised in my home town and I was treated badly because of it.

So I was in the playground one day just playing with my best friend when one of the teachers comes up to us, she tells me to stay where I am and takes my friend away somewhere.

I wait about 10 minutes and my friend came bck and told me that we couldn't be friends anymore because the teacher had told him I had autism and I was a bad person because of it, and that is how I lost my best friend.

But it doesn't end there, one day I was in class and my teacher sent me to the headmaster for no apparent reason, I went and was told how important friends are in life and that I should make more friends when I leave school.  What I was told by another student was that while I was out of the classroom my teacher had told everyone I was autistic and to stay away from me and they all agreed, this went all the way through my entire school life and I ended up leaving my hometown after making no friends but a ton of enemies. 

I've had people tell me that teachers aren't allowed to divulge information like who is autistic or decide who you can make friends with etc.  But I'm from a small town and the world is full of corruption and assholes where rules are broken constantly."
You aren't allowed to learn because your autistic,"I'm 28 now but this affected me all the way through my school life.

At an early age I was diagnosed with autism, or retard syndrome as some of my teachers called it, the teachers knew about my autism and treated it like the plague and they wanted rid of me as much as possible.

So I remember things happening like this through my entire school life, but when I joined the Academy (What we called High school) things got a lot worse for me as I found out I wasn't allowed to learn while I was at school.

Now to clarify, I could go to class and read from my textbooks, but that was it.
There's the rule in clads where you would raise your hand to ask a question and thr teacher would go around students in the order that they raised their hands.  

Unless you're disabled mentally such as being autistic.

So I would be going through my textbook and get stuck somewhere and raise my hand, and the teachers would ignore me as long as they could, often making me wait for 10+ minutes for any assistance from them, but to make matters worse was that the rule of who puts their hand up first and on which order didn't apply to me.

Let's say that students A and B raise their hands and then I raise mine, then D and E raise theirs, the teacher will go in the order of A-B-D-E-Coffee break-Me and often I would be sitting stuck for an entire class unable to continue because I didn't understand the coursework correctly and by the time she was done with the others the class had ended.
Another situation is where I raise my hand and the teacher actually comes over to help me, if anyone else raises their hand then the teacher will immediately leave me to help them regardless if I still need help or not.

I was also placed into a special support class that was incredibly insulting, the classroom had children's books, toys and other things you would give a very small child to play with, like building blocks and toy wooden trains and the support teacher spoke to me in a very condescending way, like I was a 3 year old and i was given very basic school problems to solve, like how to spell apple, what is 2 + 2 etc.  I was also given a very special kind of laptop word processor to use for all my written exams, I don't know what it was called exactly, but it was a green keyboard with a long but short screen on it, much like a calculator screen just very wide.  This thing could display a whole 2 lines of text on it at once making it annoying to do anything with.

So as I'm progressing through high school we were given the choice of which classes we were allowed to take, we had mandatory ones but for every free slot on our timetable we were allowed to select a class from a list of availavle classes.  I went around my teachers asking to be allowed to take their class and most of them outright turned me down because they thought I wasn't smart enough, in the end I had a lot of free time in my timetable but I still had to be inside the school during those times, so silent study hall basically.

So throughout my entire school life teachers would refuse to teach me and I left with lower grades than if they had actually taught me.

My grades weren't bad, I was getting some Bs and occasionally A and C so I wasn't doing so bad for studying basically by myself for all of school.

One of the few good teachers did tell me something before I left school though, I'm not 100% sure how accurate this is but this is what I was told:-
Apparently teachers would get a bonus to their paychecks if they got a certain number of students in their classes with A grades so what teachers would do is focus more attention on people they thought would do well, and ignore anyone with a mental illness or handicap because there was no incentive for them to do so, just more effort and less time spent on the genius kids.

Well after leaving school I found that trying to get a job with autism isn't exactly easy as there is still quite a bit of prejudice against people with autism and I spent a good few years searching for work with no luck.  Eventually I learned I could apply for disability benefits because of my autism and I could apply to my doctor to be deemed unfit for work.

Well after having a shitty school life and having a hard time finding work I just settled down into a life on the benefits system, I've been called lazy and a waste of human life because I don't need or want to look for a job, and because I am given more money than some people with full time jobs, but I just see it as karma, I was treated badly, wasn't given a fair chance to learn at school and was effectively set up to fail, so I don't really feel bad for just living on benefits.

I am actively studying Japanese language at University though so it's not like I'm just gaming all day."
The Worse English Teacher Ever!,"I've been holding off on posting this because even THINKING about this teacher makes me stressed and anxious. I'm not even in school anymore! But here I am to tell you about this teacher. This may be a long one.

So I'm going to call this teacher..Ms. Bipolar, because I had her for all of high school and she would switch from being helpful and nice one year to bitchy and stubborn the next year.

CAST
Me: Me
MBP: Ms. Bipolar

As I mentioned in a few of my other posts, I have high functioning autism. I also have depression and anxiety. Because of these disabilities I struggle dealing with things like war, death or upsetting things like that.

At the beginning of my Grade 11 year the class was given a sheet that told us what books we were reading for that year. I had looked over the sheet and noticed one that I knew I wouldn't be able to handle. So I quietly brought it up with Ms. Bipolar after class. I thought she would be understanding because in past years she would be and would allow me to switch to a book that was still about war but wasn't as heavy. She told me we would discuss it when we got to that book.

I understand and leave at that. But as we get closer to reading that book I brought it up with her again and she completely FLIPPED.

Me: MBP. Can we please discuss the upcoming book?

MBP: What about it?

Me: Well it's just that it's a very heavy book with themes I cannot necessarily handle..

MBP: Well that's just too bad! You don't see anybody else crying about it! Why didn't you bring it up when I handed out that paper at the beginning of the year!

Me: I did but you said to discuss it closer to when we would be reading the book.

MBP: I never said that!

Me: I don't understand. We've done this last year. Why is it not possible this time.

MBP: Because I said so! Now get out of here!

I had to leave because she was not being helpful. I discussed what had happened with my parents and they weren't happy. They brought it up with my guidance counselor who went to talk to MBP. MBP then told my guidance counselor that I had never talked about switching books before now. She insisted that she was more than willing to let me switch books. I was made to look like a liar. But I brushed it off because I wanted to pass the class but this wasn't the end.

The next month we were reading a book called ""Lord of the Flies"". At first it didn't seem so bad. But as the book went along it got more and more bloody and violent.

I bought it up with MBP.

Me: MBP. May I talk with you about Lord of the Flies?

MBP: Of Course!

I explained how I was struggling with the book because of the bloody and violent themes. I told her how I was getting nightmares which in effect I couldn't sleep. This caused me to not do well in my other classes. I told her I was getting anxiety attacks every time I had to read the book

MBP: Too bad! You need this for emotional credit. It wasn't a problem before so it's not a problem now.

((BTW IF ANYONE HAS HEARD ABOUT THIS EMOTIONAL CREDIT THING PLEASE LET ME KNOW))

Me: It wasn't a problem before because the book doesn't get this bloody and violent until later in the book.

MBP: I don't care! You aren't getting out of reading this book! Deal with your ""emotional"" problems on your own!

I gave up and went to my grandfather for help. He was a  superintendent so he would know what to do. He was shocked to find out I was reading Lord of the Flies because usually it's read in college or university not Grade 11 high school. My parents tried to reason with MBP but it was no use. I had to suffer through that book and was a mess for so long.

One day we were writing reports about the book in the computer lab when I got a HUGE anixety attack. I was dealing with no sleep, failing my other classes, my aunt getting breast cancer AND this book all at once. I wrote on a word document ""Having an Anixety Attack. Please leave me alone and do not touch me."" Then I put my hands on my head and quietly took deep breaths to come down from my attack.

Every 5 minutes MBP would come over and TOUCH ME ON THE SHOULDER and tell me to get back to work. Every time I would explain that I was having an anxiety attack and needed her to not touch me until I could calm down.

She does this 3 times then calls me out of the room.

MBP: What's wrong? Why aren't you working?

Me: *explained what I was dealing with and told her I would get back to work as soon as possible and politely asked her to stop touching my shoulder because it was making it worse and therefore it would take me longer to calm down*

MBP: Oh Anixety attacks are no big deal. Get back to work.

I go back to my computer literally breathing heavily. I sat down and suddenly MBP is standing behind me. She said she would not leave until I finished my report. I couldn't get any work done that day.

From then on she would not leave me alone. Every single silent reading MBP would either stand in front of the room and stare at me, Stand behind me or get the EA to stand behind me while the student who actually needed and PAID FOR the EA was struggling on the other side of the room. When I asked her to stop she would say that she was the teacher and it was her job to make sure students were working. Even though that is true, silent reading is the one thing I actually did well in because I could choose the book I wanted.

But MBP would constantly bother me demanding to know why I could handle the book I was reading during Silent Reading ((Binge by Tyler Oakley)) and not the class book. Needless to say my anxiety went up every single time I walked down to that classroom.

My parents finally had enough and made a meeting with the principal. The principal first talked with MBP then with my parents and I. Apparently MBP told the Principle that I was ""disrespectful"" to her in class ((I never was disrespectful. I always spoke calmly and politely)) and how I was not doing work at all. So we didn't get any where with that.

The next day we were given an article to paraphrase. I read over the article over 5 times and didn't understand it. It was written at University level reading. So I asked for help from MBP ((Stupid mistake on my part))

Me: I've read over this article and the words are too large and I'm not understanding. Can I please use my phone to google some of these words so I can better understand?

MBP: Well what you are supposed to do is take this article and paraphrase it.

Me: ._. Yes I am aware of what the assignment is. The problem is that I cannot understand the article that I need to paraphrase.

MBP: What you are supposed to do is take this article and paraphrase it.

Me: That's not what I'm struggling with-

She keeps repeating this over and over I explained over what my problem was. I eventually give up and tell her I got it. Here's what I wrote down because I knew this would be shown to my guidance counselor.

""I was told that that assignment was to take the article and paraphrase it. I unfortunately cannot understand the article because it's written with large word that I don't know. I wasn't given assistance when asked for it.""

MBP was not happy with that. My parents however took the article I was given and let my brother (who is in university) read it and even he was confused about what the article said. My grandfather also looked over the article and agreed that it was not fair that I was not given assistance when I clearly asked for it.

I was so glad to have graduated and escape that MBP. Yes I said escape! I'm very grateful to have had my family to get me through the painstaking English class from hell."
I cant eat tomatoes because of this teacher,When I was 5 i used to go to a kindergarden where the teachers where kind of shit.It was a normal day when we were eating lunch and I decided that i wasnt hungry and didnt want to eat my tomatoes.Although the teacher knew that she still forced the tomatoes in my 5year  old mouth as I tried to push that crazy bitch away.Needless to say that after that event i was traumatized and hated tomatoes for ever.To this day I still cant eat tomatoes(before everything happened I enjoyed eating tomatoes)
Teacher doesn't notice a riot going on behind him,"So this happend a while ago so I don't recall what happend exactly but this is as close as I can remember.
I had a supply and it started of normally but he needed help with the register so someone helped him, he gave us no work to do so the hole class started to talk which got quite loud and he didn't say anything then people started throwing things (pencils, pens, paper) and then a fight brewed and only then he turned around and told them off."
“Why Are You So Weird?”,"I had a teacher in elementary school who picked on me quite a bit. We were required to wear uniforms and most of the girls preferred wearing the skirts. One day I went to play with one of my friends at recess and we rolled down a hill. This teacher started screaming at me for forgetting to wear shorts under my skirt and thoroughly embarrassed me in front of my friend and other classmates. 

The next day I remembered to wear shorts. But, then something happened which I’ll never forget. I was a bit slow changing back into my regular clothes from my PE outfit one morning and she barged into the changing room, once again screaming and asking why I was taking so long. She saw that I was putting on shorts under my skirt LIKE SHE ASKED ME TO and said, “What is wrong with you?! Why would you put on shorts under your skirt? That’s so weird! Why do you have to be so weird?!” I didn’t know how to respond so I just mumbled, “I’m sorry...” as she stood there impatiently tapping her foot, huffing and puffing until I finally finished getting my skirt on. I honestly think that teacher played a huge role in why I have trouble opening up or being myself around people. Nothing I ever did was good enough for her, even if it was something she asked me to do."
Went to religious school without being religious. Was told that if I eat pork I’ll get cancer when I was 9. Haven’t eaten bacon since.,"I have so many horror stories from both primary and secondary school.

Both are religious Jewish schools, but my family aren’t Jewish. We just have a friend who is and she got us into really good schools that just happened to be Jewish. 

I had a very orthodox female teacher who hated me and my siblings. We had a talk about healthy eating and the food pyramid. This led to a talk about kosher rules. In Judaism you cannot eat pork. It is considered unclean. My dumb ass knew nothing about this, I told the teacher ‘pork isn’t dirty. It’s tasty’ or something to that extent, a meaningless innocent statement. 

My teacher took this as a me trying to turn the rest of the class against her. Trying to make the jews try pork. She kept me after class and ‘explained to me’ that pork gives you blood colts. And you’ll get a heart attack or heart cancer. I started to sob. She said that’s why we can’t eat it. It gives you cancer.

I didn’t eat bacon or sausages or ham for weeks until my mum noticed. I explained that I know it’s giving us all cancer. My mum screamed at the teacher. I still don’t eat bacon."
My teacher tried to fail me. I still don't know why. Nor do I know why she hated me.,"A little bit of important information that you need to know about me during high school. I had an IEP which if not followed, a teacher will lose their license. This is standard across the board for all teachers.

My IEP was set up in 7th grade. I kept it until I graduated, mostly for the teachers to know what might set me off. I had (and still do) Asperger's Syndrome. It's a very mild case and is under control, but I wasn't diagnosed until 7th grade when it became apparent that my depression and anxiety were symptoms of something more. 

As a result of the Asperger's and being a kid, I often was caught looking out the window and not appearing to be paying attention. However, I would be paying attention and, even though my answers were slow and my words deliberately chosen, I'd be able to answer any question without issue.

Until everything was finalized with the diagnosis and IEP, I'd often be scolded by teachers and punished for not paying attention. I would often completely forget what I said unless my words were deliberately chosen or written down and homework would quite literally, vanish from my mind. I'd do it, be able to answer questions to prove it, but the physical homework to turn in wouldn't be part of my memory. This wasn't entirely due to the Asperger's, but I do have an absolutely terrible memory. 

I know it can sound like these two things, the bad memory and the paying attention when it looks like I'm not, contradict each other. I completely get it. But I'm sure you want to know why this is important. 

The IEP was put in place with certain things teachers must watch out for. Either because it wouldn't resonate with me or because it could send me into a state of depression. It asked for some (as I was told) standards things like extra time on a test or being allowed to go to a different room. Instead of yelling and getting angry, talk to me calmly and explain what I did wrong. If I forget a physical assignment (mostly for math worksheets tbh) allow me to hand it in late with no penalty to a certain point. 

On my end, my behavior had to be exceptional and I had to maintain an 85 average in order to pass. Everything on the IEP was available to every teacher I came into contact with for every year I had it.

I had one teacher, who absolutely hated me. This teacher, like the title says, tried to fail me. 

I had her first in 8th grade (my high school was grades 7-12, so also a middle school.) She taught English, the subject I was consistently good in because I love reading and writing. I was, and still am an exceptional writer. 

When I had this teacher, she didn't do anything to violate the IEP, but by that I mean, she ignored me the entire year for as much as she could. If questions were being asked, I would only get met with a very patronizing voice and was swiftly shot down from participating. This didn't hurt my grade since she didn't count it.

The second time I had her as a teacher was in 11th grade. During this time, I had sat through her ""partners"" class the year before. (They were practically inseparable) and whenever she was in the class, she would either comment along the lines of ""About time he said something intelligent."" Or an oh so common ""Of course you get this one wrong."" 

I had also brought up, at the end of 8th and 10th grade, how I saw her in class. I even had a couple reports in the office throughout those years where I'd gotten detentions for ""talking back to her"" when 2 classmates backed me up when I had actually said things along the lines of ""at least I'm asking a question"" when she made those remarks.

During my junior year, she started playing hardball with me, since it was clear that the school wouldn't step in about this. (Probably because it still came down to her word vs mine.) I noticed immediately that she wanted to challenge me which I accepted. Every assignment she graded was never good enough. 

She would give me a different copy of a major assignment saying ""This should be more on your level."" And it was something she had given in 8th grade. I didn't care. No matter what was put in front of me, I put in everything I had and maintained a 93 average. It was during the end of this year that she told us that she would be teaching AP Literature. (Basically a college course in high school) I wanted to do it. When I told her, I knew she hated me by her response.

Me: Hey Mrs. Shitface, I think I'm gonna take you're AP Lit Class next year.

T: That's really funny. You should stick to the easier class with Mrs. Slow.

Me: I really don't want to sit through her class though. I prefer the fast pace you teach at. 

T: Well thank you. But you're just not smart enough for college. Stick to Mrs. Slow.

12th grade, I take AP Lit and see that she is visibly upset at this.

T: I thought I told you that this would be to hard for you?

Me: Then shouldn't you help me rise to meet the challenge? 

She handed out the syllabus and I smiled.

I knew this was gonna be hard, but I knew that it was worth it and that I could do it. Especially if the teacher was honest. She was not.

I made it through a quarter of the year before I was forced to leave her class with a 32 average. To her, she had won. To me, I had failed. The truth, was unknown until next year at college. Thankfully, despite the 32, I managed to pull my grade up to an 88 by the time the year was half over. Mrs. Slow really was the easier teacher who fought for me to have the 32 discounted because she couldn't see anything wrong with them. 

I really don't know why we didn't think anything was weird when she said that, but I also didn't care.

College rolls around and I have an amazing English professor who admittedly was really cute. One day, the class is just talking about high school and I had mentioned Mrs. Shitface and what happened.

My professor recognized the name. On Saturdays she teaches a night class to graduate students and it turns out Shitface is in her class. I emailed her and asked if she could look over some work her student graded me on. She told me to bring in as much as I could find, so I brought everything from senior year and her AP Lit class.

My professor was furious. As she looked over every rubric and essay (I only had 7 essays and they were each like 3 pages) she tells me 2 things.

1. My essays should never have been failed. Perfect? No, certainly not. But more than enough to pass any class by a wide margin and had explained to me how.

2. Shitface had accused my professor of targeting her for poor grades. Saying she's being dishonest about everything. 

I let her keep the homework because she said she wanted to teach her graduate class on ""Academic Dishonesty"" in a couple weeks.
 
But after that I really don't know what happened. I didn't really ask, it just felt good to know that I would have passed. I do still wonder how things could be different if she didn't try to fail me and actually tried with me.

That's my story. I'm really sorry if it seemed like I rambled. I'm still working on that when it comes to storytelling. This was the worst teacher I've ever had."
Teacher Doesn't Know Definition of Racism (Or Sexism),"DISCLAIMER: This is not exactly what was said, but close.

Just thinking about this story makes me mad. Here's the cast:

OP: Me!

T: Teacher

F: Friend

OF: Other Friend

So, I will tell the story of the lesser evil first.

In history, which is right before science, we had learned about how women tried to get more jobs (and did) in the early 1900s. So here's what went down in science.

F: (Something something) Because before then, a lot of women didn't have jobs.

T: What? That is way over the borderline of being sexist.

OP: But it's true!

T: \*ignores me\*

&#x200B;

SECOND STORY.

BUCKLE IN.

OF: Oh, so your dad had a wife before your mom?

OP: Yeah, her name was \[name\] and she was Hispanic and a flamenco dancer.

T: (From across the room) I am hispanic and that makes me uncomfortable.

OP: What? I'm just saying a fact. I'm not trying to be rude.

T: Berates me for 5 minutes.

OP: Puts head on desk and cries.

10 minutes later

T: OP, come into the hall.

OP: Ugghhhhkay.

T: That is really offensive, what you said. 

OP: \*Starting to cry\* I'm not trying to be rude.

T: Yes, but you don't need to bring that up.

OP: But it was part of the story, they met in Spain.

T: What?? Hispanic is not Spanish.

OP: Oh-well she was both (She was) (And even MY DAD her EX HUSBAND said it was an easy mistake to make.)

OP: I'm crying really hard by now.

T: You don't have to be so emotional.

Teacher went on yelling at me for around 15 minutes.

&#x200B;

This really hurt me because I know I am not a racist person, and she made me feel so bad about myself for a while. Luckily I'm moving on to the next grade and she's transferring to a different school, so I won't even have to see her around.

Thanks for reading this far!"
Learning Center Teacher Calls me Disgusting and Other Fun Misadventures with Satan,"If you don't know what Learning center is, it's a small room for kids with mild disorders who can stay in mainstream classes to get assistance. If you've seen those teachers who usually sit in the back of the room and bug one or two kids, that is the person who runs those rooms. I was mainly in Learning Center for social reasons, as my grades were A's and B's. But the teacher who in there had no idea what I had, and would absolutely get everything about me wrong. I have Assburgers and ADHD. She would force me to sit on my hands when I'd draw on my papers, force me to look in her eyes, screamed at me, forced me to sit alone whenever I forgot one homework, and would force other things on me. 

The main thing I remember was that I had forget to take a shower for 3 days. I would usually wait for 2 at the time, so my hair would be a bit gross. This teacher grabbed me by my wrist, drags me into the hall, and calls me disgusting and that none of my classmates like me. I was honestly baffled that this person was actually a special needs teacher.

It's not like I didn't tell anyone either. I told both the Dean of Students and my Guidance Counselor. They wrote me off as a bad student using false evidence to get there beloved teacher fired. So, she got away freely while I had to suffer her for two years."
Screaming in Video Production class,"Sorry if this story is a bit long.

I spent several years in my video production graphics team. I had gotten really good at it over the years, mainly due to my experience in art and also my studying graphics technology since the age of 12. I'd done a lot of stuff on the team, even at one point working with the student in the studio's position of video engineer to improve the way the older technology handled graphics so we could do more with it.

Our teacher had told me that I was, ""the best guy we've ever had on graphics."" and he ended up putting me in charge of the graphics team my junior year. In my position I had to coordinate with other teams, gathering information from the field crew about weather and sports events, and the offices about things like college visits. Every day I was all over the place working very hard to ensure things were the best they could be. Of course I also worked on some of the graphics myself, but mostly I just ran around and looked over the other team member's work.

But during that time I observed something strange. My teacher didn't interact with the graphics team much so I hadn't seen him often up until then. But I began to observe him acting very strangely towards the students. Mainly yelling at them and telling them that they were really p\*\*\*ing him off with, ""excuses"". He often accused them of slacking off. Now I don't really know if they were or not, but by their reactions, they seemed more terrified of him. I don't think they were slacking off at this point because they seemed to scared to do something like that. I asked them how it made them feel and they said he told them that this is what it's like in an actual studio so if they can't handle it here, they aren't fit to work in a tv studio at all. Thing is, most people in that class were there because they wanted to eventually go on to work in a big hollywood studio some day, so of course a statement like that would get to them.

Then something else happened, something that ended up causing me to leave the studio for senior year. It was testing season. The school was using the area my team was working in for PARCC testing so my team and I were stuck in a small office room to work on the graphics and we were provided these old laptops. This was actually different from the past as they didn't usually use that area at this time. But the school was behind schedule. Now at first things were progressing as usual. But when the graphics were done and we were ready to turn them in at the control room, something happened. To understand what, let me first explain how we turn stuff in each day.

\-We would make the graphics,

\-place them on a thumb-drive,

\-then give that thumb-drive to playback in the control room.

We had finished all the graphics. But when we plugged in the thumb-drive something happened. The laptops weren't reading it. We had no idea what was going on and we were freaking out because something like this doesn't usually happen. Eventually our teacher had learned that we hadn't turned stuff in so he came into the room and yelled at us. We told him that we were having a technical difficulty. He responded, ""Really? A technical difficulty this late in the class? You think I'm dumb?"" He clearly didn't believe us.

It took us awhile to find a solution, especially having a 40 year old guy screaming behind our heads, but we basically tried different thumb-drives just hoping one would work. We did find one, and turned our graphics in. But at that point the period was almost over, and playback didn't have time to add them to the timeline, render or anything. In other words, we were to late.

After all this time, I've actually figured it out. The laptops we were using were ancient and probably didn't have up-to-date drivers. It's no wonder we couldn't use the thumb-drives on those things, they probably couldn't tell if we'd plugged in a thumb-drive or a gaming controller. It seems the most likely considering the thumb-drive that worked was an older one.

The next day our teacher asked to speak with the graphics team before we began. At that point, he yelled at us saying we were to slow yesterday and clearly we need to increase the speed at which we work. In fact, there was also a time when the graphics team could finish in 5 minutes. By the way that has happened, I've seen it. But only for days where there was basically no announcements that needed graphics.

I tried to tell him at that point, maybe in a slightly annoyed way as I was beginning to be fed up with him, that what we told him yesterday was true, that we did have a technical issue that prevented us from using the thumb-drives. He yelled directly at me, ""I don't care about your opinions."" After school that day, I sent him an email detailing everything that had happened.

However while I was writing it, I wondered. All the stuff I've seen him do, yelling at my peers and everything, perhaps I should ask him to stop doing it to all of them. I then added a little bit at the end of my email and just thought about it, and second guessed myself. For context, I finished writing the email at 3:30 pm 30 minutes after I got home from school (fast writer), and I sent it at around 8:00. I second guessed myself, wondering if I was doing the right thing. What if I'm over reacting, what all the students I saw before really were slacking off, and what if the things this guy said to my team really was the right thing to do. I'm not exactly an administrator, but I do understand how to lead, but I ended up deciding that I needed to tell him he needed to stop mistreating the class.

The next day, my teacher told me not to work with the team and to instead wait for him to speak with me personally at the end of the period. Of course since the class was in the Media Center I wasn't without entertainment, so I just grabbed Frankenstein's monster and started rereading it while I waited. He eventually spoke to me and told me he was removing me from the graphics team, instead placing me in the field crew. He claimed I was giving him hate, which kind of confused me as I avoided insulting him, mostly just citing the experiences I've had coordinating with the other teams.

I brought this before the counseling office, which brought it before the principal who asked me to speak with him about my experiences with him. The office spoke with the teacher and began further investigation, but the guy still has his position. Whether or not he still yelled at students I don't know. I was no longer talking with other teams as much because I only had a small position in the field crew.

Also the whole thing with me being in the field crew seemed a bit weird. I had spent so long in graphics and now I was suddenly supposed to use a camera? I had very little experience with those things outside of the basics of cinematography that all newcomers must learn. Not to mention, it was almost summer, so there was very little I would learn. It honestly felt like an attempt to make my grade dwindle right before the end of the year.

&#x200B;

Just curious, did I make a mistake somewhere? I feel like there were things I should have done differently. Maybe bring this to the counselors sooner, and without talking to him first. Or perhaps the mistake was in me thinking there was something wrong with him. I honestly don't know and I guess it doesn't entirely matter anyways since I'll be going to college anyways."
Teacher literally abuses children,"Hello there! I'm new to reddit, on mobile, and english isn't my first language so sorry for formatting issues

For context this teacher has been abusing and mocking children for as long as i can remember she has been harrasing students, actually physically abusing students and overall being a dick also this'll be a short one

My english teacher is always harassing students, teasing students, physically abusing them (which is illegal where i am unless it is a spanking) one time I saw my teacher pull a students hair and CLOTHES LINE HER FLIPPIN' FACE she then decided to PUNCH THE CHILD pretty sure thats already assault on a minor. So have you people here ever seen a child hysterically criying all while her teacher is using a metal ruler to hit their fingernails after clothes lining them? Cus i sure have

I'll post updates when the crazy english teacher gets fired cus' i KNOW she will since my mom is deciding to get involved and either tell the principal or call the police, either way i hope my classmates will be safe once i get back to school and my prayers get answered that this unholy devil of a teacher gets fired.

UPDATE: i know many people didn't read this but to the few who took the time to do so, thank you, but back to the topic at hand, sadly my devil of a teacher didn't get fired BUT my teacher did gt 2 strikes 1 more strike and she is gone so the teacher is on her best behavior she hasn't done anything crazy yet but she has made students cry, she has pulled a childs cheek so hard the child started bawling and it left marks this is the end of this story for a while but i'll keep all of you updated.

On a side not I am sorry for my weird English like saying the word ""peeps"" I am only 11"

Teacher punishes me for sweeping too fast,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

So today's story happened a few years ago when I was at arts & crafts.Usually we have this rule when the lesson is done you've got to help clean the classroom.So I did exactly what the teacher ( T ) asked for.

Btw I'm a dutch 15 years old boy. I can go on very well with other teachers. My grades are great and school goes well. But T was a teacher everyone hated. She always was someone who would punish fast and without a reason, which brings meto this story.

So I did what she asked for and cleaned the floor. A few of the other students were just doing nothing exceptjust playing and making a mess. T ( I think ) just had a bad day and a lot of students names were already on the board including my name ( Probably for talking but I don't mind that ). When I was sweeping I tried my best so it looked like I just was trying to sweep through the floor but that wasn't it. I wanted her to see that I did my best so she would be a bit happier in me. Instead she wrote a cross behind my name on the board ( for the people who don't know a cross means detention ).

I of course got a bit mad but asked polite and respectfull why she did that. Here's the conversation:

Me:"" Why did I get a cross behind my name? What did I do wrong?""T:"" Yeah, you wasn't doing your job"".Me:"" Yes I was, didn´t you see me clean the floor?""T"" I don't care, you sweeped too fast! That's detention"".

At this time I got really mad because the other students who were really not doing their jobjust could go home and I needed to stay with an other student who was really just innocent.

Before I go further I gotta say Don't swear at you teachers. It's just unneeded and just gets you further in the problems.I at the point called her a B\*tch which I still regret. It just wasn't needed but I legit got mad.

That day I had an hour detention, I needed to clean the floor and had to write 100 times' I listen to my teacher when she tells me things'. Lol but I skipped 30 minutes because I just left. I still feel badass :)

Have a nice day."
About to graduate. Here’s a story about my worst teachers. Part 1.,"So, it’s my 9th grade year. Brand new school new people and all that. So I head down to my 2nd period math class, where I meet my new teacher, “mr fatz”, I call him. So he gets done telling us freshmen where everything is in the class room. Me, being a slight bit autistic, wanted him to relate some of the info is had missed. Well, just as I when to raise my had , the fat ass says, “I will not repeat my self.” I’m like ohhhhkeh wut the frick do I do. So due to my sever lack of organizational skills, I lose a lot of work, which nowadays I keep at school, but this was then, and when I when to ask he’d say he didn’t know. So I essentially failed the 9th grade cause of this ass fuck.

My Science Teacher was a hypocrite.," The Cast

I/ME=Me/OP

BT=bad teacher 

BF=Best Friend

This story was when I was in high school, and we had a new science teacher, I had two different teachers, one for biology and one for chemistry, and the one that was the hypocrite, was my biology teacher this started in year 8 or year 9 (I live in the UK) and this teacher picked me out of the crowd almost instantaneously, we started to talk about the immune system and we had to draw, a diagram of the human body and what parts of the human body helps to protect against bacteria and to fight viruses and infections etc. (I was on a taxi to get to and from school as I lived far away from the school and my class was at the end of the day) when I handed the work I did in, she said they wasn't enough detail on the work, and my BF was a little confused because I did more work then hers and she was allowed to go, she waited for me and BT said I had to do more, so I did I added several more labels (hand written) and she still said it wasn't enough (I already explained that i had to get a taxi and the other students on that taxi was waiting) BT then said that I would have to finish it the next time i was in, (I didn't because she didn't bring it up again).

The next lesson, I was sat next to BF because she let up pick our seats and we would talk, but it was always about the work, and it would be if BF didn't understand something and I did, I would explain to her the best I could and the same was if I didn't understand the work (I almost always did) but if I needed help I would put my hand up, and ask for it, she would always say ""just let me finish with this student and I will be right with you OP""  she would never come, she would always go to a different student and I would be left their for about 10 minutes with my hand up, so I would get fed up and literally figure it out for myself and it would be right almost all of the time, and the half way through the year we all would get SMART targets (this stands for Specific, Mesurable, Achievable. Relevant and Time) and she put on my front of my text book ""you must put your hand up when you need help"" when BT left the room, BF said ""that's very hypocritical you do put your hand up and she never comes and the work you do is right"" the girl behind me asked what BF ment and she told her way BT put on my text book, and I asked to look at her diagram from the beginning of the year only 4-5 labels and I said what she did wasn't fair and she asked why and I told the girl who sat behind me what she did and how she kept me behind, for ""not doing enough work"" and then roughly about three/four weeks before we left for the summer holidays she move ME and BF away from each other and said it was because we were always talking and BF said ""we are talking about work and not disturbing any other students"" where as other students who would sit together and be loud, rowdy and distracting was able to still sit and work together. 

I never reported her because I was actually quiet and didn't talk very much to people who I didn't know, I would gladly answer questions and that but would speak often to other people in Class apart from BF.

Kid gets sent to the office by dumbass Spanish teacher,"Back when I was in 8th grade I was a student aide where we basically chill in the office until we need to do something. One day, my mom was picking me up early and I ran into this kid in the office and we talked for a while. Eventually I asked why he was there and he told me that he had accidentally knocked over a stack of papers in class and the school's Spanish teacher thought he did it on purpose and sent him to the office despite what he and other students have said. I'm not sure what happened next but I hope he didn't get into trouble.

Tl;dr: Just read the fucking story, it's not that long"
Sociology teacher hates white people,"My sociology teacher is African American and she always spends the class ranting about how white people run the world and have all the power and talks about white privilege a lot. I understand that some of this may be accurate but it's not the only thing we should talk about in a sociology class. It's also uncomfortable for me because I'm the only white person in the class. She often gives me pointed looks and talks about how everything us handed to me and I will never know the struggle her people go through. Several times in several different class sessions she has also made the absurd comment that ""black people cannot be racist; only white people can be racist"". When I challenged her on that she told me that only people with power can be racist and black people cannot be racist because they have no power. I strongly disagree with this and it makes me uncomfortable analyzing race so much in class. She also says that ""most white people take guns to school to shoot people""."

so a little background info

yesterday while I was at recess, one of the kids in my grade (i was in a small school, only about 100 kids in all and 10 in sixth grade) got very very angry.  now, this kid (let's call him ty), had a history of being violent towards my classmates.  in second grade he tried to drown my friends Colin and cole, at Colin's birthday party.  his reason, not having the ball passed to him in pool catch.  later that year he threw wooden blocks at our teacher, and flipped A DESK ON HER FOOT.  in first grade, he tried to stab my friend with a pin for no reason.  now, to get to the thing he did during recess.

the reason he did this was that he was gotten out during knockout (a basketball game where the people behind you have to score faster than you).  shortly before that, he had gotten hit in the lip (accidentally) with a basketball because he was not looking and talking to someone when it was his turn.  he went into FULL RAGE MODE he started by trying to punt the basketball away, but my friend Matt, swatted it out of his hands. guess what he did next, HE PUNCHED MATTHEW IN THE FOREHEAD AND THE SHOULDER.  He then went for three other people Dominic, Abby, sage (the person who got him out) but my other friend Evan (who had also been the one who helped save cole and colin from drowning) got in the way and started to hold ty back so he could not hurt them.  a few seconds a teacher came over and stopped ty and sent him to the nurse to quarantine him away from everyone (Matt and Evan also went because ty punched them multiple times).  today I just found out one of the stupidest decisions from my principal ever. EVAN, MATT, DOM, AND SAGE HAD GOTTEN DENTITION.  he said they got detention because they apparently used their hands and touched ty. of course they had to f\*\*\*ing use their hands, they couldn't just stand there and let ty pummel Dom, Abby, and Sage.  They had gotten dentition because they were trying to protect other students.  last time I checked, detention was for kids who had done something bad and should be reformed for their actions.  but these four kids had done nothing wrong.  sage and dom and done almost nothing but stand or flee as ty came to punch them.  Matthew had swatted the basketball to prevent it from being punted, something that if we did one more time, all of basketball would be taken away, and Evan the hero was standing there trying to protect his friends by trying to push ty away.  ty himself had gotten a ten-day detention (note, there were only 8 days of school left) so we won't be seeing him for the rest of the year."
Loco Spanish Teacher,"Before I start, I wanna say that this did not happen to me, but to someone who was in one of my classes.

In middle school, there was this middle aged Spanish teacher who I will say is very loco. I never had her so I did not experience this first hand, but I heard about the things she did from my friend who took her class.

One of the things was that she said the moon took her mother's heart and that's why she died. I do respect beliefs but this.....was something else.

But the worst thing happened last year (and yea I'm somewhat fresh out of middle. Starting sophomore year/year 10 this August)

During 1st period, my friend who took her class told me about how earlier in the week, she took one of his classmates up to the front of the class and ridiculed him.

The reason for this?

Every week, she had them do an assignment which I believe required citations from news sources. She is 100% liberal, and one kid quoted Fox News in the assignment.

I get some people don't like the other political views, but come on. He's just a kid.

The ironic thing is, the kid's parents took it to Fox News, and they did an videocamera interview with the father and kid.

I never liked how they decided to make it nationally public, but I could see why they decided to.

The teacher did not get fired, but I'm sure she'll quit soon if she hasn't already.

Also my middle school might be in some more hot water because as far as I've heard, during the annual Washington D.C. trip, a kid fell from a Gettysburg moment and broke almost all of the bones in his body. I feel like it's fake but I'll research it tonight and see if it's true.

EDIT: So it turns out the 2nd story is true, here's a link to an article: https://www.abc27.com/news/local/teen-injured-in-fall-from-gettysburg-monument/2024776847"
A teacher scolds class for talking for 20 mins and above.,"So this was a few months ago and it was the last lesson of the week, my usual teacher was of so I had a supply.
So I walk into class like usual and see the supply who looked normal and nice but boy was I wrong everybody was talking and she told the class to be quiet as usual then proceeds to go on a large rant repeating the same sorta thing ""if you don't listen you won't get good grades"" by the time she actually started to teach it was 20 minutes into the lesson, I had to go to play an instrument and asked the person next to me if she did it again and she did it 5 more times in the lesson.
I'm glad I wasn't there for that"
