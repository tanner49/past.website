0,Parking pass,"I called their front desk today, and learned they put up an Instagram account with more info about the building since it's new. It's @walnutgroveiu if anyone also wants to see"
1,Anyone living in Walnut Grove?,
2,How liberal?,Why do i have to wait in line for a parking permit i thought i could just buy one? How long does it usually take?
3,Where is my class if my schedule says Recreational Sports (RS) 110?,Rn i am drowning bc I got to a predominately white republican school where people call themselves super spreaders and make jokes about how being gay is bad and how pronouns are weird. 75% of them end up going to IU each year. As a non-binary queer person I can’t spend another 5 years closeted. Is it easy to avoid those types of people or will it be the same environment?
4,biotech class - should i take it?,"No luck using the IU Campus map, can anyone help?"
5,can i bed loft in willkie?,"hi! so i’m thinking of taking biot-t 105 “biotechnology in society” this fall and need some advice, has anyone here taken it?? and would you recommend it?

for context, i guess, i’m a business student and am interested in working in the biotech industry. not sure if i’ll do the biotech minor offered at iu, but i’ve interned at a biotech company already and wanted to know if this class was worth taking!

edit: class is taught by prof daniel watts"
6,Do my roommate and I both need to bring fridges?,i’m a freshman moving to willkie but i’d really like to loft my bed but it’s not giving me an option on the website. is it not possible to do that?
7,Where to rent/buy mini-fridge?,"We both have mini fridges and microwaves, are we allowed to have two fridges? And if we are do we even need two?"
8,Teter dorm bed lofting,"I already have a microwave, but it seems like bedloft only offers a mini-fridge/microwave combination unit. I'm having trouble finding any other way to rent one near in Bloomington, so I'm considering buying one. Any recommendations for renting or where I could buy an inexpensive one? I'm a senior and I likely won't need a mini-fridge after this year, so I'd prefer to rent one. This is the first time I'm trying to find one because I haven't needed one in past years because of roommates/living in accommodations that already had a fridge. 

Thanks in advance for any help!"
9,ST parking,"I haven't been able to find any information about lofting my bed. Is it not allowed, do you have to have a certain person do it for you? Can't figure it out."

11,Is a suitemate the same thing as a roommate?,Can I get into Housing before 7th August because I need to travel early due to the Covid-19 pandemic in my country and I will arrive Bloomington on 2nd?
12,What calculator would you recommend for Math-M211?,
13,Parking Passes?,
14,College of Arts and Sciences requirements (Biology B.S),Anybody know when parking passes will be distributed? I’m currently on the waitlist for campus parking but you’d guess they’d at least offer stadium parking by now?
15,Rate my schedule,"So the degree map for the biology B.S. degree it says I need a foreign language done by first semester of my freshman year. I’m having some scheduling conflicts and I might need to take Spanish second semester in order to take a specific class to keep my scholarship. Does anyone know if I would be allowed to ask Spanish second semester instead of first? (I’m aware it would probably be smart to email an academic advisor, which I have I’m just anxious for an answer because the class I need to take might get filled up :) )."
16,What happens if you fail a freshman I-core prerequisite class?,"Hey everyone, I’m a Kelley da and saw other people doing this and was hoping everyone could give some advice or reassurance. Thank you in advance!

EALC-C 101-Xiang Lyu, Yingling Bao

BUS-A 100-Jamie Seitz

17,Is there some sort of dental facility available at a discount for students at IU?,"I’m in Kelley, and didn’t pass one of the required first year classes. Online it says that this class is an “I Core prerequisite to be completed by the end of the first year” I didn’t take the class over summer, am I fucked? Need a sophomore or upperclassman to lmk what is gonna happen when I go back to Bloomington lol"
18,can any Jacobs people help me out?,"Looking to get my teeth cleaned +  wisdown teeth removed. I don't know if I just should get them done at my hometown, cuz its a bit pricey over there. Does IU have some dental clinic within the school that has exclusive rates for students?"
19,Mcnutt Crone,"so I currently plan to audition (well complete and prescreen and hopefully get an audition after that) for the music ed program (w a voice concentration) at jacobs, but i’m having some trouble finding how the audition will be formatted. I live in texas so if a virtual audition is an option it’d be preferable. my sister, who is also applying, says that she’s seen that as an option somewhere, but i can’t find any information on it, and the website just takes me in circles. does anyone know if there actually is a virtual audition option? it’d be for fall 2022 if that helps

edit: editing to note that I’ve tried to find contact info for admissions admin who could maybe help me out with no luck so hopefully one of y’all know something- fingers crossed lol"
20,Missed X170 Course because IFS office didn’t inform that the program was full.,Im a freshman and was just assigned a double in mcnutt crone floor b. Does anyone know what it is like to live there/what the people are like? Also where is floor b? I have heard that is the basement?
21,"Anyone who has majored in Informatics, focused on business -","So I have missed half of the X170 because I thought that I was accepted at IFS program. As far as I know, students have to choose either IFS or X170. What do I have to do now?"
22,Is it harder to get into IU as an out of state student?,"I’m a rising senior in high school and absolutely love IU but I’m not able to get into Kelley as a direct admit. I am considering attempting standard admission, but need a backup plan. I recently came across informatics, and the stats on the major were really good, and I saw I can connect it to business. The degree map on the IU website isn’t working so I just have a few questions- Can someone explain the type of classes I will be taking in this major, will I have to be coding, and constantly working with computers? What kind of jobs can I get within this major? Can I just get a general explanation on how informatics can connect to the world of business? Any replies would be appreciated."
23,Looking for Barber/Hair Salon in Bloomington,I feel like it was pretty easy for me to get in with average scores and grades in state. I’m seeing all these people post their stats being hella good and asking if they can get in with like 4.0s and 1400+ SATs out of state and I’m like damn is it competitive out there or like just for scholarship money? Might be dumb question
24,Foster group chat,"I am looking for a barber/hair salon in Bloomington, preferably with experience cutting Asian male hair. Any recommendations? Thanks!"
25,IFS Class Times,"Sorry to any who saw the last post and thinks this is annoying or repetitive but I’m making the post again for anyone who is new to the sub or might have missed the first one.

Greetings incoming freshmen. I’m an incoming freshmen who was assigned to the Foster buildings and have created a group chat for other students in Foster. We currently have 5 people in the chat and that number will double once everyone receives and adds their roommates. If anyone else in the Foster buildings would like to join the chat (we use Snapchat) then please either message me privately or comment. 

Thank you and have a great day :)"
26,Any roommate news?,Has anyone received an email about what time your IFS class is? Mines suppose to start this Monday but I don’t know what time the class is or where the class is at when it moves to in-person.
27,I have a 3.5 weighted gpa. A 31 act score. From Louisville. My extracurriculars are ok not impressive but not bad either. Can I get into Indiana university for computer science?,"Has anyone heard anything about when roommates will be announced? I got my housing assignment on the 9th which stated that assignments would be announced later this month, has anyone heard differently?"
28,Same class twice in one day?,
29,IFS MUSIC TO REVOLUTION TEXTBOOK?,Am I supposed to have the same class twice in one day? I probably should've asked the advisor while I was scheduling for classes but I didn't notice in the moment. I have CHEM-C 117 from 8:45 to 9:35 and 11:15 to 12:05 on Wednesday.
30,What furniture/layout would be in a 4 bedroom suite at Willkie Center?,"I would like to know if anyone has the music to revolution course for intensive freshman seminars

31,How bad is Wright Hall??,"Anybody know like how much kitchen storage there is, whether the living room is furnished and with what? Any details are much appreciated:)"
32,hey anyone in ΒΘΠ at iu? trying to rush there and i have a few questions,I know I'm going to regret asking this but how bad really is Wright Hall for dorming? I unfortunately got stuck in Wright (even tho I requested an enhanced dorm in northwest way before the priority deadline) and am kind of concerned about the reviews I have heard so far...
33,Still getting emails from IU,
34,Illusions in Culture IFS Course,"Hello I had applied to Indiana for grad school a last year and decided on a different school but have started getting emails and updates from the university as if I had enrolled there. Things such as financial aid updates, covid procedure updates, etc. I never enrolled so I'm not sure why I'm getting these emails but I would like to stop getting them without full on blocking all of the IU accounts. Just wanted to know if anyone had advice on who I should talk to about this. Thanks!"
35,IU or Purdue for Premed?,"Hi everyone,
Did anyone take Illusions in Culture last year?
How was the course and where can I find myself the course material for free?"
36,3/2 Program?,"IU or Purdue for Premed?

Purdue is seen as “better” in Indiana than IU bc not everyone gets into Purdue However, I haven’t heard any good things about Purdue as a strong premed place bc they are so science and engineering based. However, I’ve done research at IU and a lot of premed people go there and just seeing from the advising pages (Purdue has a single pdf document that’s not helpful), IU seems to be a better fit in terms of premed advising and vast research and hospital volunteering opportunities. I was just wondering if anyone had any anecdotes to give or any info that could help me."
37,ST parking spaces,"Hey guys, do you recommend the 3/2 program (3 years for bachelors, 2 years for masters). Why or why not would you recommend?"
38,Fall 2021 rush,"Any ""ST"" marked parking spaces near Swain hall, or on that southwestern side of campus?"
39,I’m a Incoming freshman does anyone have any comments on the forest single dorms?,"I heard rush is starting during the first week of classes, was wondering what you would have to do to rush before hand. I saw on interfraternity council Instagram that there is an application and a 20 fee that you to pay, do you need to have that all done if you want to rush? As well as should you fill out the interest forms on frat websites?"
40,Question about networking at IU and the difficulty of getting a job after college,
41,Foster Housing group chat?,"Hi guys! I am going to be an incoming freshman at IU studying accounting at the kelley school of business. I am still debating on whether or not to join a fraternity. Many people who I’ve talked to said that joining greek life will help you tremendously w/ networking, jobs, etc. But there is also a part of me that wants to stay away from greek life. With that being said, are there opportunities to network without being in a fraternity? And how does the difficulty of finding a good job compare? Also, any advice on joining or not joining a fraternity? Anything helps!! Thanks"
42,"Is out of state worth it for direct admit to Kelley(30k)? I have another school option ( North Central College, Honors) that is almost free for first year and 5k a year after. Please give me advice on this.","Incoming freshmen assigned to Foster double. I think it would be a good idea to maybe make a group chat for others who are going to be living in Foster, especially other freshmen. I think it would be good for us to meet new people close by, and be able to socialize with our peers.

If anyone wants to join or help create the group chat let me know, could use as many people as I can get 😃"
43,McNutt Questions,
44,Foster Bathroom Situation,I'm gonna be a freshman living in McNutt this fall. Are the floors co-ed? Also are the bathrooms communal style or individual pods? Is there any difference between the different buildings (north/south/central)? What's the party scene like?
45,Read hall bathrooms,"I'm in the Collins LLC at Foster this year, and I'm in a Foster Double. I know it's a group showering situation, but is there a toilet attached to each room or are those also situated down the hall?  Thank you!"
46,Short tips for incoming freshmen,"So does read hall have some rooms with full bathrooms? At first my housing assignment said large read double with half bath. Then my roommates changed to large read double with bath, and so did mine."
47,Calculus Course Question,"Since the semester is swiftly approaching, I've decided to share some of the key tips for you younglings. This list is reflective of my own experience and what I've witnessed from my undergrad experience (and grad school experience) and hopefully this will clarify a thing or two for you. 

1. You definitely want to bring a mini fridge and a microwave to your dorm. If you're living in a dorm, then cooking is practically out of the window. 
2. You should bring something to decorate your dorm room. Most of the residence halls look like prison cells and it's up to you to make it look lively and homey. 
3. Don't smoke or burn your microwave in your dorm room. Every room has a smoke detector and they are sensitive. I've seen someone getting kicked out because they got annoyed and destroyed the detector. Imagine how annoying it has to be. 
4. If you need a ride after going out late at night, IU provides safety rides for students: search for IU Ride.
5. Unless you absolutely need a car to commute for a good reason, you don't really have to bring your vehicle for your 1st year. Most of you won't be eligible for parking permits with better options and still end up taking buses throughout the week. 
6. I-bucks is not exactly money-saving, but campus dining halls and stores are everywhere and easy to find. For what it's worth, I think it is a good option if you prefer to stay on campus for the most part of the day like I do. 
7. Make sure to ace your first-year classes. They are mostly introductory and easy to get good grades if you put in some effort. But if you somehow screw up your grades in year 1, then you will find yourself struggling for the next 3 years to make up for the loss. 
8. A lot of things can happen in life, and your instructors will understand it. But first you need to tell your instructors of what's going on for that to happen. 
9. You want your professors to remember you (obviously in a good way). One professor that I've managed to impress asked me to write a letter to the chair of the department so that he could be promoted (this was part of the procedure in his tenure-track) and in exchange, he wrote me a letter to grad school. 
10. Make as many friends as you can. Networking is also a part of university experience, and you never know when that network will come in useful. Besides, IU is a partying school and you want to get as many invitations to hang out for fun. 
11. Start looking for next year's housing as early as possible. IU has approximately 50k students and it can get rather competitive to find a good place. If you're thinking about on-campus apartments (campus view, tulip tree, etc) for 2nd year and above, it is best to sign up no later than October. Off campus housing can wait until Spring, or even Summer. I would say Spring semester is the safest time to start looking for housing (around March - April)"
48,Freshman assigned to Ashton single dorm,"Hello I am an incoming freshman and I am very excited to be on campus! 
When selecting my courses with my advisor, she placed me in Calc 1 even though I got a 5 on the AP calc AB Test, which I thought meant I could skip calc 1 and go to calc 2. I did get a lower math placement test score, but on their advice I retook and got a waaay better one haha. I think that this would qualify me for calc 2, but I don’t know if maybe it’s worth retaking calc 1, If anyone knows if that class is similar to AP material"
49,Helpful IU websites for new students,"I've seen a few posts and people say on here that Ashton is pretty bad. So, just how bad is it? Or will I manage alright?"
50,McNutt,"I’ve noticed that there are quite a few people that are new to IU that have a ton of questions that are easily found on an IU website. I decided to provide links to these websites so that people can get accurate information directly from IU instead of waiting for a Reddit response 

Housing/RPS: housing.indiana.edu (you can find dorm room photos and other information here)

Parking: https://parking.indiana.edu (this has all the information on permits)

Bursar/Registrar Questions https://studentcentral.indiana.edu (there’s a really helpful FAQ here that answers many common questions about the bursar and scholarships)

These are the top three that I used to get information freshman year but there are a ton more. In general if you have a question just google the department name to get their website and there will be answers to questions there."
51,Spring and Psych!,I got my housing assignment and I’m in McNutt. Does anyone have any information on the singles they offer or the dorm in general?
52,Jobs at Bloom,"Hi guys, I’m planning to apply for IUB’s spring entry, majoring in psychology and I have several questions! First of all, is the spring similar to fall entry? Will you still have orientations? Secondly, how good is the psych department at IU? I still have time to apply to umass amherst, uiuc, are they better at psychology than IUB? Thanks!"
53,Is Read Hall really that bad?,What small jobs are around campus? I’m looking to maybe get a job after i settle in as a freshman.
54,Does anyone know why bed risers are banned? What would happen if you use bed risers regardless?,"I got my housing assignment and got to live in Southeast neighbourhood, even though I requested only Northwest. I am low-key sad for not getting where I wanted. I read the reviews and Read Hall seems as boring, non social and distant place. Is it really like that?"
55,How many hours per week should I expect to devote to an 8-week course?,I’m having trouble imagining how I can fit everything
56,When can I buy a CH3 permit online?,"I'm an incoming grad student who is interested in taking 4 classes. 3 are regular session courses (August-December) but one is an 8 week course (August-October). My advisor said they're super intensive but I've never taken one before so I don't know how many hours people typically commit each week to an 8-week course. 16? 20? 

In short, if you've taken a **graduate level 8-week course** and can share your experience, I'd greatly appreciate it!"
57,Whitten has Covid,"Asking those who have purchased one in years past when they were able to buy a CH3 permit.

I am moving in August 7th and heard that permits will go on sale the same day or the day after. If I had to, could I buy the CH3 permit in person the day I move in and keep my car on campus without having to make a second trip? It would suck to have to come back a few days later in order to have my car, but just wondering what other people's experiences are."
58,Dorm room.,"Dear IU Community,  
 

Just now I learned that while fully vaccinated for many months, I have tested positive for COVID-19. I began experiencing mild cold symptoms this morning and immediately isolated myself. I got tested shortly thereafter and received the results a few moments ago.  
 

Gratefully, my symptoms are mild, and I will continue to work and lead the university during this time from my home office.  
 

While the vaccine is not 100% effective, I am so grateful to be protected from more serious symptoms.  
 

I encourage everyone to get vaccinated as soon as you can.  
 

I look forward to being back in the office soon and to seeing all of you on campus for the fall semester.

59,Economics degree as a fallback?,"Did we get assigned to our dorms yet??? Also, when should we arrive at Campus? Freshman here."
60,Anyone else feel really disconnected from campus after the COVID online year?,"Hi! I’m a rising Senior in high school, and I just visited Bloomington. I absolutely love the place, and really cannot see myself anywhere else. It’s a dream to get into IU Kelley, and unfortunately I do not have the high school grades to be a direct admit, and I will have to take the standard admission route. I know that this route is very hard, and risky, because If I don’t get in I would most likely have to transfer to a place where I can study business, and get value out of my degree. I was researching and noticed that the Economics degree was apart of the college of arts and sciences. I was just wondering if I did not get into Kelley, would I be able to easily get into the economics program, or is that just as hard? It would be nice to have that as a fallback, because Econ is a great major, and something I am also passionate about."
61,When to look for a new roomate tulip tree.,"As an incoming junior, I've spent half my time at IU with nothing but online classes. I stopped attending clubs last year and activities like campus council because everything was just awkward and ill-productive zoom conferences. My circle of friends is basically no larger than the people I knew from high school. 
They're claiming that things will mostly be in person this year, but as I'm living in a single apartment off campus, I won't have the sorts of resources you get as a freshman in the dorms to make connections. I know the whole world's been impacted by this whole pandemic thing but it really does feel like my social life got plain deleted by the shutdown. I'm not sure how I'm gonna re integrate, or if I'll be able to."
62,"SAVE MONROE COUNTY in the Great Indiana County Vote Off! It's down to Tippecanoe and Monroe - don't let IU, Lake Monroe, and Bloomington be voted off the map! Monroe posts = ⬇️ Tippecanoe posts = ⬆️ (Comment with the most ⬆️ gets voted out of the state.)","So this will be my last year with my current roommate. They are graduating in 2022, I’m staying an extra year and planning to stay in the apartment. 

For tulip tree specifically, should I start looking for a new roomate for the 2022-2023 year now or should I wait a little longer? It’s been a while and I don’t remember when people usually start looking for housing. I know the renewal dates for people already living here and newcomers are different."
63,Signing up for housing,
64,Does anyone know why beds cannot be lofted in teter?,I’m going to be a sophomore this year and I’ve been confused as to how to apply for housing in a residence hall at IU. Do I even need to apply for on-campus housing since I was staying on-campus last year? I tried applying on one.iu but it wasn’t working and gave me a phone number and email (I tried using the email but it didn’t work either) and I’ve sent two emails to the askRPS last week and still haven’t gotten an answer. I’m just really confused about what to do and any help would be appreciated.
65,Evening jobs?,
66,jobs at iu for freshmen,Anybody know of any jobs preferably on campus that have evening hours where I would be able to work just a few days a week? My last class ends At 6:10 pm and I’m just looking to work a few hours after classes.
67,How good is the wifi in dorms to play video games?,"what are some chill jobs that i can work at iu? i’ve worked at starbucks for almost a year and it’s literal hell so something that won’t make me cry everyday lol. i’m going to be a freshman this fall and can’t take on too much.

maybe something closer to southeast?"
68,IU Kelley Test Optional Petition,
69,Library Jobs,"Hi, IU Kelley is one of my top choices, however I have been unable to take the SAT and I intend on applying test optional. My weighted GPA is a 95, which I think is equivalent to a 3.8. How does petitioning for a direct admit spot work, as I am a rising senior, hoping to get my IU app done first?"
70,Andre Owens,I’ve been wanting to work at one of the libraries on campus for a (hopefully) pretty easy and chill way to make money. Are the RPS library jobs worth it? And did IU really raise the minimum wage to $15?
71,Hey im a sophomore and i was wondering if any producers wanna link,
72,I-Core and a Job?,
73,Transfer students and housing,Will I be okay if i work a part time job and do i-core at the same time? I don't really know the time commitment for i-core so I want to make sure I have my bases covered before working.
74,Thoughts on I Bucks 25. My son is an incoming freshman and living at home.,Anyone have experience with transferring to IU as a sophomore? Also can transfer students live on campus and are there ppl that live on campus besides freshman?
75,Dorm room information,
76,Regency Court Apartments,Hey guys I’m an incoming freshman and I was wondering when we get information on our dorms and move in day. Thanks!
77,Study Abroad,"For anyone who has lived in Regency Court Apartments on S Henderson, do you know if the ethernet ports work throughout the Apartments? If they do, where do I plug in my modem? Employees don't seem to know."
78,New laptop and iphone,Can I study abroad twice? I’m in the Kelley School of Business.
79,Making money back from season tickets,I am an incoming international freshman this Fall semester and I wondered should I buy laptop and phone in my country or get it when arriving on campus? Any recommendations for best place selling these stuff?
80,Should I bring my car to IU?,I'm a grad student witha family and would love to go to dinner games this year. How many combined fb/bb tickets would I need to sell to make my money back? Spending that kind of money on tickets isn't really an option for me unless I can get a good about back.
81,Independent but only offered a crumb of financial aid...,Is it worth having a car at IU?
82,Suggestions on what to choose to complete WorldLanguage&Culture GenEd requirement?,"Did anyone else receive similar?  Only received the frank o bannon grant and the federal loans, nothing else, even though I have $0 in assets/am independent."
83,looking for a roomate in varsity court apartments,"I’m in the kelley school and need advice on what to choose to fulfill this GenEd requirement…(whether it’s study abroad, taking two world culture courses, etc). I also took Spanish in high school so I’m somewhat familiar w/ it"
84,Out of state tuition,"one of my roomates just backed out of his lease and me and my other roomate are looking for someone to fill his place. The apartment is right by the stadium, its $575 a month, and me and my roomate are quite and clean. If you or someone you know is looking for a roomate please dm me"
85,Test Taking Rooms?,Does anyone know if there is any possible loop holes or ways to get get tuition reduced? I heard you could transfer to another IU campus and get the MSEP but I’m not sure how that would work.
86,IU Arboretum about '85,"Hi, I plan on taking a standardized test for graduate school admissions, it will be full online with live proctoring. Does anyone know if IU has a section of Wells or someplace specifically designed for standardized testing?

I'm pretty sure the proctor won't allow any monitors or screens in the room so I'm afraid the Business/SPEA library is out of the picture."
87,How big should my mini-fridge be?,
88,Admissions chances,I am an incoming freshman assigned to a Teter Single. I’m looking into getting a mini fridge for my dorm room and don’t know what’s too big or too small. Any suggestions?

If someone could help me out I would greatly appreciate it :)"
90,Anyone have any suggestions for a laptop?,"which is better? my roommate and i are deciding between the two and need to pick before tomorrow. i am picky about bathrooms but also i like that the communals get cleaned and we don’t have to do that. are forest bathrooms coed? i saw that they only have private bathrooms and are all communal. 

please tell me which is better. i am taking lots of courses such as ethics and poli sci etc and am not sure about the distance to the classes either."
91,Need information on IU legal services,I’m an incoming freshman majoring in accounting at the Kelley school so I know I’ll be working with numbers a lot. Any thing helps!!
92,1st semester questions,"I am unsure if this is the correct place to post this. I ran into the notorious Jeff Jones who's been in trouble with bloomington dating back to 2016, long story short the man owes million's. To keep this short it sounded normal for him to check my ID for a background check and I let my guard down not doing a background check. And he has my identity, does anyone know what IU resources there are for this? Because he could easily get my FASFA information etc and essentially ruin everything and i'll have to drop out of IU. I imagine this mans credit is awful, so I can see him using my perfect credit score. "
93,Seeking furnished room in shared apartment for a friend - female/sophomore. Preferably walking distance to campus near downtown. Any leads appreciated. Sublet fell through. Already checking fb.,"Hello hello hello!

So, I *just* got accepted for fall semester less than 24 hours ago. But- they haven't sent me any info on how to register for the classes that start in like 5 minutes, given me an email, or any of those things. All I received was a welcome email (which is so nice, v happy that they did that).

All that being said, what do I do? I have my degree mapped out, so I don't really need to talk to an advisor, but I also think its mandatory to speak to an advisor at a lot of schools? I don't know I'm lost plz send help.

Thanks so much xoxo

EDIT: fwiw I am a 2nd year transfer from community college"
94,Is a mini meal plan cheaper than buying campus food?,
95,Anyone know anything about Teter in Central?,"This coming semester will have me on campus all day every day. The past few years I’ve brought lunch, but I don’t think I really want to bring multiple meals a day with me to campus. so I was thinking maybe I’d pack one meal and buy one meal. With that in mind, is getting a mini meal plan cheaper than buying a meal a day? 
Also, I’ll be studying abroad second semester so I would only be able to use the plan for one semester.

I’ve looked into the CBT clinic and center for human growth but i’ve seen bad reviews about CAPs.

102,EDUC-M200?,"Hi I’m a junior transfer for Fall 2021 and the deadline to enroll is in a few days. A lot of my credits transferred over as undistributed and I know that means that IU says they don’t have a class to match it. 

My question is, if you have undistributed credits, can these credits still possibly fulfill certain requirements on your degree map (things like the CASE requirements or IUB GenEd requirements?) I’m trying to see if I can get some of these requirements filled by the classes I already took at my other college, so that I can graduate in 4 years.

If anyone knows the answer to this I’d really appreciate it so much. I emailed some academic advisors but I think they’re busy since it’s new student orientation season."

If anyone here is a grad student in CS, I would love to know what you think of the program. I love education too, so being a TA is a no brainer in my opinion. Lastly, is the program fully funded (i.e., you get tuition, room and board, etc. paid for either through assistantships or otherwise)? Thanks!"

Don't really have a specific inquiry.... but would love to hear from anyone in the same boat. And does anyone have any random advice for getting acclimated?

I'm concerned I'm going to feel really lonely. I'm an ambivert so I know i'll enjoy some alone time to recharge but I also really like being extroverted and making friends and being social. I'm scared that it'll be more difficult to transition to college, especially without a roommate where we can make mistakes and learn freshman year together.

Actually, I can enroll into the class itself but I think the only available lab is at the same time as the class I chose(because that was the only available class). It is an evening class, and there's a good amount of evening labs open. 

The lab I'm on position for on the waitlist is from 8:45-10 in the morning. I purposefully chose this. Other times do work for me and I will be position 1 on the waitlist if I chose any other time, but I thought people r more likely to drop out of a morning class and there's a good amount of evening slots open so PERFECT for them, if they take the other version of discrete structures. 

Basically what are the chances I get removed from the waitlist? Can I request to join the class?"

So my plan would be to do the gen ed courses near my hometown at IUSB for the first two years, before transferring to IU Bloomington for the rest of my education. Has anyone done this route? Is transferring an easy process or complicated? Thanks for any help in advance!"

233,can freshmen live on union street if we already got 3 other roommates?,"I am a political science major considering Indiana University. I have posted in this sub before and was recommended to look into O’Neill and Lugar Schools. I’m interested in both. I’m wondering if anyone can tell me more about each school and their experiences there. What’s it all about, what do they offer, and what makes them worth applying to?

I told people that I was interested in PoliSci, as well as public administration, policy, and international affairs/relations. This is why a few people in this sub told me about SPEA and Hamilton Lugar School.

How does IU-Bloomington compare to other Midwest PoliSci schools (UW-Madison, Michigan State, and OSU)? Originally, many said that a PoliSci degree from IUB wasn’t worth it. I’d probably only go to UI-Bloomington for O’Neill or Lugar School if I was accepted not for a regular PoliSci degree.

I graduated IU in December, and while I wait to start law school in the fall, I am offering high quality low cost LSAT tutoring. Applying to law school is crazy expensive, and LSAT tutoring,  the cream of law school preparation, often runs in the hundreds of  dollars. Powerscore, for example, charges $175 for private tutoring.  Well, I am here to help!

&#x200B;

**A little about me:**

I  got a 176 on my LSAT, which I took on the last in person administration before COVID. (I was sick and had cut off my finger tip a couple weeks earlier and actually underperformed my PTs.) I will be attending the  University of Michigan in fall on a full tuition + stipend scholarship; I  am living proof of how much money can be saved by quality LSAT prep! As  evidenced by my score, I am well versed in all LSAT subjects and even  helped one student eliminate her testing anxiety. I have been tutoring  in various subjects for almost ten years and have been tutoring for  several months in the LSAT (see comments eventually for testimonial from  my current students!).

**What you're paying for:**

One-on-one  tutoring including going through problems, teaching the underlying  concepts in logic, and fine-tuning your strategy. As an ""introductory  offer"", your first two sessions will be $30 apiece and $45 afterwards.  That's a 50% discount for your first two hours! And it's a 75% discount  on the major prep websites.

&#x200B;

For now, I am doing online only, but once I'm fully vaccinated (May), I can do in person.

281,Questions about IUB Intensive Freshman Seminars (IFS),"This sem has been quite tough for me with COVID, being an international student and other personal problems. I wanted to know if anyone had an idea about failing all classes in a semester in one’s sophomore year. I am currently not failing anything but the possibility is quite high that I fail one or 2 classes. So just wanted to know what would happen next if I did fail."
282,What are some good beginner investment and real estate classes for someone that knows nothing about that field and is a science major?,"I recently enrolled at Bloomington and I received an email regarding IFS. Before sending my application, I do have a few questions about the program, as the information provided in the email/website was insufficient. Any help is greatly appreciated!

Is the program just a single course taken+finished before school or does it stretch into the school year?

Objectively and generally speaking, how difficult were the courses or the program in general? 

If it is convenient, I would also love to hear your personal experiences with the program."
283,Ifle/star research program,"I don't even know if I can register for them since I am in the College of Arts and Sciences, but I would like to learn a little about real estate and investing, just take a small dip into that area. Like I said, I have no background high school knowledge in the area. Are any classes particularly useful?"
284,Question about the foreign language placement exam,I have applied ifle/star research program as incoming freshman.Do you have any idea when they will publish the decisions?
285,Forest/southeast dorms,Can you skip foreign language requirement completely if you do good on the exam? Or do you just get placed in a higher level class?
286,How difficult is the second interview for the MSIS program?,I’m going to IU next year and considering living in forest in the southeast neighborhood. However I heard the only social dorms are in the northwest neighborhood. Is forest a quiet and more reserved dorm? If so I don’t want to live there. I’m also a business major and I heard it’s far from Kelley but I’m okay with walking 15 min.
287,Can I transfer local community college credit over to IU? I was dual-enrolled this year and I have some credits.,"Hello all! I passed the first MSIS group interview a few weeks ago and am waiting to schedule for an interview with the president of the MSIS program which will be the final interview. Honestly I don't see myself as a super strong candidate, however I did apply as a sophomore so I do see myself at least having a chance either this go around or if I choose to apply next year.

Does anyone know how difficult this second interview is going to be so that I can prepare for it? The first one was pretty stressful since I had to find ways to make myself stand out among upperclassmen and people with a career. Thanks for any help!"
288,How bad is it to not have a AC dorm? Does it get really hot? Is it worth it?,
289,ALEAKS MATH EXAM,
290,Podcast interview with IU Professor Katie Siek about health informatics research,What’s a good ALEAKS math placement exam I got a 70 is that to high or to low for Kelley.
291,IU Bloomington vs ASU vs SJSU | FOR BUSINESS,
292,Git Tutoring,"Hi, I am a hs senior. I got into ASU's W.P Carey School of Business for the major I wanted. I also got into a local college which is San Jose State for business. As well as also getting into IU Bloomington for pre-business (not directly admitted into Kelley School of Business). I would then have to do the standard admit process, in order to get in. It's a risk though because if I don't get the required GPA, then I'll be in IU not being able to pursue a business degree.

Was wondering what would be better for my major since IU Kelley School of Business is top 20 business schools in US, but that SJSU is not really ranked. I really don't want to be that close to home as I am from the Bay Area, but IU seems like a whole new experience and also a risk (since I am not directly admitted into the business program). ASU however, I already got into the business program, its close but not too far from home, campus is amazing, top 30 business school; however tuition there is expensive and I didn't get much money from them. Neither did I get a lot of money from IU either.

I am deciding between these three and would like input from other people. I also don't know how this whole job application process works and what hiring managers look at and what they take into consideration. Any advice would be helpful. Thank You."
293,Is IU going to be online next year? Does anyone have any idea about it?,"I’m in need of tutor to get me started in the wonderful of Git. I’m currently enrolled in an online program, but haven’t been able to grasp the basics and could use some coaching, reviewing, etc. 

Anyone out there? Referrals?"
294,Places to do Physical Therapy shadowing hours?,
295,Looking for Partners to start a company,"Basically what the title says. But I’m applying for physical therapy school next year and need to fulfill shadowing hours for PT school applications. I’ve looked everywhere, but most places are declining PT students due to COVID. Does anyone know if their office is accepting PT students? I’m hoping to knock out a decent amount of hours this summer as I’ll be in the Bloomington/Indy area."
296,How difficult is it to get into Kelley specific clubs first semester as a freshman,"Hello, I'm a freshman here at IU studying finance and entrepreneurship. Over winter break I came up with a business idea and since then have been laying the groundwork to launch. I've spoken with many people trying to discredit the idea but it has held up to this point so I believe its a worthwhile venture. It's going to be an ecommerce business specifically in the sleep industry.

I've done a lot of work this far and plan to buy the domain very soon. At this point I believe the next step will require partners. 

**What I'm looking for:**

1. **Someone who can run social media pages**. This could be someone with a marketing background or someone who simply feels comfortable starting a social media page. After talking through my idea the next step is going to be popularizing the website through social media because it's a free form of marketing.
2. **Someone with a sleep science background**. One of the differentiating factors of the website will be the scientific backing of products and although one can do research to get a rough understanding, I think the company would be best suited with a partner specifically dedicated to this effort.

If you feel that you fall into one of these categories and are interested in finding out more about the opportunity, feel free to PM me. I'd be happy to talk through it. Thanks for reading!"

Can someone also let me know what the best classes to take freshman year are?"
301,BUS-A 202 Credit Transfer Change?,So I committed to IU last week and turned in my housing application the same day. A few days ago I got an email saying they haven’t received my housing application yet but it says it’s complete on my portal. Is this an automated message or should I call the school to get this figured out?
302,"Got admitted to B.A computer science but want to change it to B.S computer science, before school starts what am I supposed to do now(I haven't submitted my intent to enroll yet)","Has something changed such that you can't take A202 through IvyTech anymore?

304,Anyone remember the Fun Guy burger at Wells?,"i wanna take finite math (math 118) during the summer session, and was wondering the process to sign up for it. the website is kinda confusing"
305,Thoughts on the Business Analytics Co-Major/Other Minors,"When I was on the meal plan from 2016-2017, Scholars Inn Bakehouse at Wells used to have this legendary burger called the Fun Guy. It had this garlic aioli sauce on it that made an admittedly low quality burger super good. Even though it was one of their most popular items, it was discontinued, even before most RPS dining menu items got nerfed with covid menus. Now I admit I’m probably nostalgically remembering these as being better than they actually were, but I’m absolutely craving one of these burgers. Has anyone had a similar burger  or have a recipe of something similar to them?

Edit: the burger iirc is Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, Garlic Aioli, Swiss"
306,History Courses please help!,"Hi everyone,

I am currently a freshman studying Finance at Kelley and am scheduling classes for next semester. I was able to bring in a lot of credits coming in and only need 14 credits left for the sophomore year Kelley map. I have also finished my GE and WL courses.

 This leaves me a lot of room for taking on a minor or co-major and I am currently considering taking courses for the Business Analytics Co-Major next year. Is this co-major difficult and would it be useful for the financial services industry? I was also looking at the Psychology minor or the Business Psychology Certificate; however, I believe I would have to forgo undertaking the Business Analytics Co-Major if I wanted to pursue these. Thanks in advance!"

319,Information About Residence Halls Move-Out,Anyone who knows anything about this any help would be appreciated. I don't qualify for any federal aid despite my mother making a quarter of what out-of-state tuition costs over four years. So I really can't fathom taking out that large of loans to completely cover my tuition. If anyone knows any good avanues to secure some money at this point that would be great. I already submitted the general scholarship application and recieved literally nothing.

I'm trying to figure out my living situation next year but its incredibly hard because I don't have anybody I can room with. 

I guess my question is: do any off-campus (fully furnished) housing complexes have some sort of roommate matching? If so, which housing would you recommend? (Preferably west of campus)"

328,Wtf is going on with the IUSG elections lmao,"Hello I am a freshman at IU. ive been switching around my major a couple times and have landed on law and public policy through SPEA.

329,Special vaccination clinics?,
330,Single dorms,"On Wednesday, we got an email to be on the lookout for a special email from the state about a vaccine clinic open to students/staff/faculty.  Has anyone gotten the email to schedule? I was hoping to be able to schedule a vaccine for earlier than what I was able to through the main state website

Edit: Thanks all! Update in case anyone is following and is in the same situation: I contacted AskIU [https://old.uits.iu.edu/askiu](https://old.uits.iu.edu/askiu). They weren't able to tell me why I never received the link, and they weren't able to resend the link, but they were able to get me scheduled for the ""closed pod"" vaccines for three days earlier than the appointment I had scheduled through the main state website (on the 11th instead of the 14th), and were able to cancel my later appointment. Not that much earlier, but it does give me a little more leeway for my second shot which will be the sunday before finals"

My little brother moved to Bloomington in January from Texas and I am obviously concerned about his ability to meet people outside of his roommates. I am a senior at Texas A&M and am trying to help him make the most of this semester while COVID is slowing down. Does anyone have any advice for him on social organizations or groups to join?

A little about him, he is a sports management/marketing major and I know he is currently on the student athletic board but with it being totally virtual he is struggling to meet people. 

I don’t really see him as a frat kinda guy, but I think he would enjoy some form of all mens social orgs. Do y’all have those? Or what are some popular social orgs in general? 

Im just trying to help him find his place so far from home, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance from Texas!"

335,Distracting ....,"Hey everyone - I'm a student down at Georgia Tech. Some fellow students and I made a website, called [Canary](https://canarystudent.com/register), to read (and write) anonymous reviews on internships and their interview process. The idea is to help students learn what internships are like at different companies and how to best prepare for them (what classes to take, what interviews are like, etc). Its already grown to over 600 reviews from companies like Tesla, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed martin, and Google.

I thought I'd throw it in here since hopefully y'all and other schools could find it useful too! The site is [canarystudent.com](https://canarystudent.com/). We really focused on user privacy as much as we can (your name/email is never displayed with the review or sold to 3rd parties.) Also we're actively developing, so don't hesitate to reach out via DM with suggestions or leave a comment on what you think of the platform.

I am an incoming international grad student at IU. I want to understand how health insurance for counseling and psychiatric help works, has worked for you individually. I would be on health insurance provided by IU, but I am very new to the health insurance system in general.

I have been on medications for depression and anxiety for the last year. I have been taking CBT therapy on a fortnightly/monthly basis for two years. I would like to continue taking my antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds, along with therapy. I would love to hear people's experiences with CAPS. I understand from this [online ](https://healthcenter.indiana.edu/fees-insurance/cost-payments.html#caps)resource first two therapy sessions are free and post that it is $35 per session. How expensive does it get to get regular therapy (fortnightly-monthly) and meds? I would love to hear a student's experience on this. Appreciate, if you have insights from anything outside IU - in Bloomington too."

I'm in TX right now and would like to come back if possible. I am considering Kelley for my MBA because of it's ranking, prestige/reputation among employers, and costs. However, it's important that I have a decent-sized network to fall back on. I looked at LinkedIn and it says that the network in TX is not as strong as it is in IN, Chicago, Cali, or New York, and is actually worse than some regional schools like UT Dallas, U of H, Baylor, A&M, and SMU. 

I guess I'd be open to other markets, but I'm pretty sure I want to stay in TX. If I were to move elsewhere, then it'd prolly be to Chicago or even a faster growing metro area like Vegas, Charlotte, and Raleigh.

So, yeah, how strong is the network in TX? I do know that Mark Cuban is here, lol."

366,Is eduroam not available outside?,"Hey Hoosiers, 

Looking for feedback on a potential platform that would provide on demand readings of case studies, textbooks, and briefings. From our research it seems like there is not a lot of audio content available outside of basic Text to speech for text books and I'd like to provide a way to generate this content. 

Students would be able to read aloud and upload audio of textbooks and cases for others to listen to and generate revenue from based on number of playbacks (Spotify-esque).  This would allow students to listen while multitasking and provide an alternative method of learning if you're less of a visual learner. 

- As students, Is this a service that would appeal to you and would you utilize a Freemium desktop/mobile service? 

- Would you consider paying for a service such as this, if so how much? 

- Would you provide content by recording yourself reading to make money on the side?

Any feedback or insights would be very helpful!"

368,IU Ladies First A cappella Album!,Hey guys so I am a freshmen at IU who is deciding on room and board for next year! I lived at home this year so I have pretty much no information on the dorms and how they are. My choices are between Mason that is in between the Central and Southeast neighborhood and the Wright quad because the other options that are available are a little too expensive for me. If anyone has any information about Wright and Mason I would really appreciate it! Thank you!

370,Athletic Grad Assistantships?,"I suffer from servere bipolar disorder. I have life long permanent mental illness. When I first went to centerstone Bloomington, Indiana. I was given an intern(yes an intern!) to talk to for about year. She was awesomt,she helped me solve allot of problems. Then I was given the A.C.T team Supervisor as a therapist. The a.c.t team is to prevent severe mentally ill adults from jail, hospitals and homelessness in our community. Ive been a member of two prior act teams in different comunities. The act team at centerstone isn't accredited. So they make their own rules. It shows ,did you see the tents in the park!I'd like to add that the therapist has never worked with severe mentally ill adults. She has never held down a job longer than nine months. She had a background in child development. Why is she choosing to work with severe mental ill adults in a supervisor position? (Probably to gain expierance,while my mind goes!) To start. I asked her to get my prior mental health records,she never did this. My axis1 is bi-disorder type 1 my axis II is borderline personality disorder. My axis iii is major anxiety disorder. That therapist never knew my diagnosises.This can be proven. I seen her for just seven months. She would no call no show. She did this five times. I was driving 60miles round trip. I choose so far because I didn't want anyone to know I was getting mental health treatment in my close knit closed community. lost my first job I held down for 15 years due to when she skipped out on the very first appointment on a Friday only to give me a 15min notice. I lost all my structure. I went downhill after that. I would have a series of panic attacks ,wondering if she was going to show up. I would sleep in my vehicle because I would have no money to get home. I was to humble to ask anyone for help because of the stigma of mental illness Once I said to her that since you no-call no showed you should give me gas money?She lectures me on ethics and tells me I should grab a gas jug and beg for fuel. They was making me come in every week. I was court ordered. I had to go to centerstone because this was the only place in town that didn't have a waiting list for services. Her excuses for no-call no show was once an ankle sprain,which was a lie. She even showed me pictures and forgot to limp on several occasions. It was the most miraculous recovery ever. One time she said she had chrones disease. I had a childhood friend who suffered and died of chrones disease.Which made me feel really bad,because I gave the therapist a hard time on telephone. I cried. That was a lie. This made me feel really inferior and that I wasn't worthy of the truth. Did she think I was that guilble? I believe one time she was speed? She had meth mosquito bites on face. I ask her about this? She says she a picker? Lol. This is the only thing I can't prove. I couldn't honestly tell Logan my problems because that therapist would laugh at my culture,the way I talked,my mental symptoms. Like she would say""imagine that"". Would roll her eyes. And would generally have no understanding and laugh at my problems. I countinued to ask centerstone management if I could go back to the intern,when she skipped out on that first appointment.They said no. She would over step her boundries. She gave me personal phone number. I gave her a pack of marlboro lights that I fond.Once she me ""how mad she was that her exboyfriend fond a new girl"". I had to be the therapist that day. She then tells me ""that being single isn't bad ,because she gets all her kisses she needs from her dog"".She told me that her hopes and dreams were to have many children.This really confused me? In a way she became my buddy after that. My friend?I always maintained my boundaries,addressed her as Ms. Therapist. Another boundary crossed was she recommended a rehab facility in Northern ohio. That picked you up from Bloomington. I drove to a parking lot to make it easier on them. I thought maybe she worked there? Maybe she applied there or knew somebody? Nope. The rehab facility turned out to be a locked homeless shelter. That was serverly over-crowded. I had to sleep in the lobby the first two nights. Because no bed was available. They over medicated me. I was having seizures and muscle spasms. There is an antidote but they wouldn't give it to me. I asked to leave.They give me the antidote,then drop me off at my vehicle. I drive off and get an OWI. She used her Id so my mom can wire me money to get my vehicle out of impound. She gives me a ride to pick up the wired cash. She has an expired ohio ID! I had to use all my charm to get the clerk to look the other way. This is my therapist! I was done with that therapist after that. That therapist manipulates me. Tells me how much she cared about me. Tells me she can fix me. It'll take months. I agree to stay with her. I later learned that have a condition called tardis dyskinesia. Which is from taking psychotropic medication over a long period of time. It can lead to parkinson's disease. That therapist should have known this. My current therapist told me this and my doctor confirmed it. I now get a vivatrol shot once a month. My doctor tells me that centerstone won't give out the vivatrol because centerstones contract with phramecutical company won't let them. Go figure? I have suicidal ideations everyday,all day for decades.Its a symptom of borderline personality disorder. She was so bad I would call my mother so she could talk me out of suicide after every session,for hours. My mother wanted to talk to her. I ask if I could sign a release she says ,I don't talk to mothers. But the therapist had no problems helping me to ask for money? Whenever I see a therapist ?I work out a mutual agreement that the police would never be called. This has caused me some minor problems in the past. Because when I'm in a manic state,I will verbally tell my suicidal ideations.l use therapist so I don't tell you,my mother,neighbor,co-worker, friends,your children! my suicidal fantasies . Also I lived in a very closed special community. That therapist knew this.Calling the police would cause me severe problems. Police scare me,cause panic attacks plus police have never solved any of my problems. Only made them worse. I've been going to therapist since I was seven. This was never a problem. That therapist agreed very positively on this. She never called the police for the many times I've explained my suicidal ideations. Plus any act team and my current don't call the police on clients and me. I'm borderline they know this. One day I was having a bad day. I talk to her supervisor,who conveniently hung up on me at 5pm. I call centerstone crisis line. The crisis line calls that therapist.She calls the police on me. She calls me to tell me this . I hang up on her. I knew my life would get difficult. I get kicked out the commune I lived in. I was shunned.I lost all my friends,they was like family for me. That commune took in a mentally unstable man. Taught me a trade. Made me employable.They really wanted to see the best of me. I was doing alright. I really was at the zenith of my life ,thanks to support of the people in the commune. What took the people of padanaram five years to build up. It took Logan Pfeiffer just 7 months to tear it all down. Six state troopers do a welfare check(because the county sheriff doesn't go down to the commune),than proceed to totally mess up my house,I guess? looking for drugs that weren't there. Luckily I wasn't home.That devastated me. I knew my life was destroyed. I had the mayor(with tears in his eyes)of the commune come to my cabin to inform me I had to leave because that therapist sent 6 state troopers to my house. I endangered everyone. I go to centerstone in state of mania. That therapist calls the police on me again. I'm homeless now. I sit with her for another appointment. I had to be a beggar. The first time in my life I had to ask anyone for help.This was the most humiliating thing of my life. She had one of her employees in that appointment,who thought is was okay to talk about her casual drug use She lies to me about a govt program and that I'd be housed in thirty days. I'm still on the waiting list. That therapist and ms.tamara giles cracksbjokes. That therapist was taking things out of context I said in prior therapy session. And was making jokes. I explain to her the hardships I'm now going to have. And explain the stigma of mental illness. The contact with police. I'm going to have and people will think I'm a weirdo. That therapist says ""you are a weirdo"". ( I almost want to think that therapist called the police on me maliciously, because I told her management that I thought she was on speed(actually Adderall) and the mistakes she was making in session,what do you think 🤔) The next day I find myself walking around Bloomington like zombie.in a psychotic state. I call that therapist to explain this. She tells me I don't know what to say. She quits the next day without a notice. She quit because centerstone was going to drug test that therapist. I can prove this. ( A close friend of hers told me this) I would have a complete total mental psychotic shut down. Bpd shackled me up(don't remember)I had to be hospitalized for a monthand three weeks after that therapist left. I now have a great therapist and doctor now at transitions. Yes, I get great mental health treatment that is 99.9% a suboxone clinic! They and me agree that my mental illness advanced because of that therapist I now hear that therapists voice calling me a weirdo like a very loud radio in my head,almost all of my waking hours. I lost all my identity,my hope, my spirituality, my independence, and lost my dignity. I also suffer sleep and eating disturbances. I have severe trust issues now. I have contact with the bpd almost weekly because I'm always yelling at that therapist. I have considerable financial and legal problems from living like a refugee. I felt abandoned,i felt it was my fault when she quit. I lost my friend. I was ghosted.This spurred my nervous breakdown. My doctor and therapist believe that considerable damage was done. Should i contact a lawyer? The state attorney general licensing board has fond probable cause of wrong doing and now has an investigation going on.My life is a nightmare thanks to centerstone and that therapist. There are now no solutions to any of my problems. Btw, I have complete caring strangers helping me getting me back on my feet.

That therapist now works with children at MCUM. Look what she did to me? Only took her seven months to completely destroy my life. Wonder how many parents or children's lives she has destroyed? ""Imagine that"""

Also, in their application document, they request my debit card data, including my CVV, which is a huge red flag.

I’m a current senior in high school and I got accepted into IUB a few weeks ago. I was pretty excited until my parents, who most definitely have the means to support me, told me that they wouldn’t be paying for my tuition. I was wondering if there was anyone that could help me figure out what I could do. I’m trying to apply to as many scholarships as I can, but they’ve been kinda hard to navigate since there’s a lot of them all over the place. I’ve also been selling as much of my stuff as I can and am trying to find a job so I can stockpile some cash. I am planning on working throughout college, so if anyone could tell what on campus jobs there are that would be helpful. I’ll contact the office for financial aid soon and see what they have to say. I should say that I am an Ohio resident, so I would be paying out of state tuition. I did apply to a few in state unis, and I am keeping my eye on them, but so far no other schools have offered me anything. I’ve already gotten the Deans Scholarship for IU, so I have a bit of something. Also I’m interested in doing research for my major - which is psych - and it looks like there’s some opportunities through the ASURE program thing. Basically if anyone could point me to some scholarship opportunities that I should apply to, if there’s anything I should know about on campus jobs, or any other information like that please let me know. Any help would be greatly appreciated. "

I plan on doing a single unit, but I am a somewhat social person so I don’t want to be surrounded by people who are gonna lock their doors every day. I’m not necessarily a partier but do like to hangout with people a lot of the time. Having good options for food would be a plus. I’m going to be majoring at Kelley but don’t think that matters since it’ll be my freshman year. I feel like I’ve narrowed it down to Central (Teter/Eigy) or Southeast (Forest/Read). Any and all thoughts help, thanks (Also: is it worth going random if I’m fine doing a single?)"

First off, I'm a little intimidated by the campus size. I'm a pretty introverted person, and it seems likely that I could find myself alone in such a big place. Are there any clubs or anything that you would recommend for a person who really just wants to find/meet new people?

Also, what is the campus culture like? I've heard that there's a lot of partying, but beyond that I'm a little out of the loop. Lastly, do you have any things you wish you would've learned/been told about earlier?

Spring semester and fall have kicked my butt. I wanna say it’s COVIDs fault but idk. Maybe it’s just that my classes are getting harder and expecting more. I’m looking at a 3.5 now and I’m disappointed. That’s close to the GPA I got in high school and I got Cs and Ds the first two years. I know that a mix of As and Bs is good enough for most jobs and if I have more Bs than As it’s probably not as big of a deal as I’m making it. My husband and a lot of my friends get straight As in their classes and they’re not easy ones either. 

Anyway, I’m hoping I’m not the only one affected by all this and that it’s a more common issue than I assume so I can feel better lol"
